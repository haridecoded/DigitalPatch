If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it’s done.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/95/82/1d/95821d7a-b10f-8336-6c98-7cead1e2af00/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN","DE","ES"],"size":"82685952","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2013-02-27T00:23:13Z","updated":"2016-10-16T20:36:19Z","version":"3.3.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":577767595,"developer":"David Crane","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/david-crane/id577767595?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://smokefreeapp.com/","score":4.5,"reviews":1414,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":16,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/84/a9/90/84a9907d-5910-4904-a6ff-07352a3ea03a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple20/v4/b8/61/0e/b8610e99-4277-bc3b-3a11-ccf1b0f6e845/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple18/v4/f7/20/56/f72056d1-6d5a-c8c9-e3da-a8be8a2871e8/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple18/v4/89/7a/56/897a56a9-d64f-e525-dab9-a09a16e7eb61/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple30/v4/d7/2e/1c/d72e1c0c-6222-5383-4bf1-b3dc30c6e715/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":468624531,"appId":"com.digitalsirup.QuitItLite","title":"Quit It Lite - stop smoking today","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-it-lite-stop-smoking/id468624531?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Quit It is a tiny motivating program, supporting and encouraging smokers to quit smoking and helping ex-smokers to stay quit. \n\nIt keeps track of the cigarettes you did not smoke and how much money you are saving.

I purchased this program and was really surprised at how having the ability to visualize your progress really helps keep you motivated to quit smoking. I have not had a cigarette in 90 days and actually have no desire at all to light up. I think this program is a great tool to help you quit.\"\n\n\"It won't do all the hard work for you but it can give you a big helping hand when the craving starts. Just look at the graphs and imagine having to go back to square one. Havn't smoked a cigarette since 19th April 2002 after being a smoker for twenty years.\"\n\n\"It really helped me personally to graphicaly see what was happening inside my body and all the other information has only helped strengthened my resolve. I haven't picked up a cigarette since I got it.\"\n\n\"Didnt knew if it was the knowledge of my cc being billed for the app or what but i have no smoked since i bought it it helps a lot to see graphically how your health is. COOL!\"\n\n\"40 years a Smoker until I found My Last Cigarette\nI've tried various methods to stop smoking over the last 40 years. Started when I was 11 years old now 52. I now feel I can say I?m a non-smoker. It's all down to \"My Last Cigarette\" Every morning I turn on my PDA to have a look how many cigarettes I've not smoked. That sets me up for another day without one. If this government is serious about reducing the number of smokers it should by this software and give free on the National Health. In my Lifetime I've smoked 433590 cigarettes but more importantly I've not smoke 4043 since I stopped on July 27th this year.

Just look at the graphs and imagine having to go back to square one. Havn't smoked a cigarette since 19th April 2002 after being a smoker for twenty years.\"\n\n\"It really helped me personally to graphicaly see what was happening inside my body and all the other information has only helped strengthened my resolve. I haven't picked up a cigarette since I got it.\"\n\n\"Didnt knew if it was the knowledge of my cc being billed for the app or what but i have no smoked since i bought it it helps a lot to see graphically how your health is. COOL!\"\n\n\"40 years a Smoker until I found My Last Cigarette\nI've tried various methods to stop smoking over the last 40 years. Started when I was 11 years old now 52. I now feel I can say I?m a non-smoker. It's all down to \"My Last Cigarette\" Every morning I turn on my PDA to have a look how many cigarettes I've not smoked. That sets me up for another day without one. If this government is serious about reducing the number of smokers it should by this software and give free on the National Health. In my Lifetime I've smoked 433590 cigarettes but more importantly I've not smoke 4043 since I stopped on July 27th this year. Do yourself a favour buy this software.\"","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/e2/d4/0f/e2d40fca-7e9a-8382-994f-f1611f7fd3e6/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","PT","RU","ZH","ES"],"size":"41017344","requiredOsVersion":"7.0","released":"2013-04-26T23:49:29Z","updated":"2014-03-23T19:56:20Z","version":"2.40","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":994180799,"developer":"Mastersoft Ltd","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mastersoft-ltd/id994180799?uo=4","score":4.5,"reviews":418,"currentVersionScore":4.5,"currentVersionReviews":343,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/e7/e3/66/e7e366a2-788b-f028-c9f3-89c1c5b50c31/screen322x572.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/db/f4/ea/dbf4ea08-a25b-8802-148a-8f0b5fa7642d/screen322x572.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fa/ce/0d/face0da5-530f-498b-fe5d-1e652f566979/screen322x572.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/77/b6/d377b6ca-2d9f-4614-3170-cf2ce3dec456/screen322x572.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/69/08/f7/6908f7ec-f6bd-a358-7a64-5ade3b0528f4/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/d0/a1/65/d0a1656c-d03d-086d-4c74-d5aac869ac01/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/c3/66/bf/c366bfcc-0f01-498c-eeb0-ecf08b6c9f2b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/f4/b4/48/f4b448ed-42f0-4799-2486-45768333bcd9/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":594755066,"appId":"com.ninecurves.PhotoJusSmokeFX","title":"Smoke - Smoking Effects by PhotoJus","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smoke-smoking-effects-by-photojus/id594755066?mt=8&uo=4","description":"DOWNLOAD BEFORE FREE VERSION ENDS \n\nTransforms your photo into various gorgeous effects by adding smoke to your photo!

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.\n\nBy using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, \ne.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We \ncan also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["DA","NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PL","PT","RU","ES","SV"],"size":"40623684","requiredOsVersion":"4.3","released":"2010-02-02T22:13:22Z","updated":"2012-08-15T18:56:27Z","version":"2.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":344500276,"developer":"On Beat Limited","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://","score":4,"reviews":53,"currentVersionScore":4.5,"currentVersionReviews":22,"screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":292329425,"appId":"kr.co.iphoneos.QuitSmoke","title":"Quit Smoking Helper","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-helper/id292329425?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Please quit smoking.\nIf you want to quit, may be you need some help.\nThis application is simple, but may be it can help you.\n\nSet the price of your favorite tobacco, and number of i for a day.\nAnd, you check to start. then this app show to you;\n\n- Your period of quit smoking.\n- Your extended life.\n- Your saved money.\n\nQuit Smoking for your life and your family.\nGood Luck!","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/3d/57/ae/3d57aea0-2817-fafc-0f5b-56296bfedfdb/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN","FR","DE","JA","KO","ZH","ES"],"size":"1212416","requiredOsVersion":"7.0","released":"2008-10-03T04:33:22Z","updated":"2014-04-02T20:54:42Z","version":"3.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":292078297,"developer":"Tae-han Kim","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/tae-han-kim/id292078297?uo=4","score":2,"reviews":61,"currentVersionScore":4,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/90/8b/6f/908b6f32-f58d-ec07-6d60-a33b487ac0e6/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/8a/32/7b/8a327b93-4833-7cdd-0799-b32371beca0e/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/aa/e3/11/aae3113a-9447-b4e4-e3f2-00f362e66347/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":592666813,"appId":"com.analognest.quitsmokinghypnosis","title":"Quit Smoking Hypnosis by Mindifi - Stop Addiction Now","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-hypnosis-by-mindifi/id592666813?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Celebrating over 2 Million Mindifi Listeners! \n\nIf you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. \n\nIf you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. \n\nLet's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: \n\n1). \"Quit Smoking- Preparation\" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)\n\nListen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. \n\n2). \"Smoking Cessation\" \n\nYou will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. \n\n3). \"Smoke-Free Sleep Track\" \n\nStart listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! \n\n4). \"Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster\" \n\nThis short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes. Listen to this to address any cravings that may come up, for any situations that may have triggered you to smoke in the past, and to quickly reinforce your reasons for releasing cigarettes and smoking from your life. \n\nWe've worked hard to build the absolute best \"Quit Smoking\" hypnosis program in the world.\n\nEnter the world of Mindifi.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/e4/a9/ce/e4a9ce0e-45f0-8234-cd31-30bceb26c45a/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6020","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"127901696","requiredOsVersion":"5.0","released":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","updated":"2013-12-07T01:08:06Z","version":"1.3","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":570601283,"developer":"Mindifi LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mindifi-llc/id570601283?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://mindifi.com","score":4,"reviews":12,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":5,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/ce/b7/c5/ceb7c57b-cab0-a81f-3db2-624bf08d0cc3/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/33/82/fd/3382fdaf-77c9-8eb6-866b-abe1277d168e/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/dd/a4/37/dda4377c-e8b1-1c85-f8d5-e8502a9808ba/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/1a/c1/51/1ac151db-cee4-f1ef-f192-8b584b459b65/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ec/96/92/ec969223-c6cc-5776-1632-33a5d729cf51/screen320x320.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/58/cf/6b/58cf6b5e-9c3d-d1e7-2201-8d4e59bd7a81/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/41/aa/1e/41aa1ec4-2646-ce50-1a4b-0810b99cb069/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/36/2b/5f/362b5f46-968d-763e-abd2-a4d21f83e319/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/e0/08/dae00845-d85c-2a21-8122-40dd50bd7e8c/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c1/58/6a/c1586a16-7481-62d6-6caa-b69fc5b80ec9/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":581893877,"appId":"nl.hqmedia.quitsmokingbuddyfree","title":"Quit smoking now – Quit smoking Buddy!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-now-quit-smoking/id581893877?mt=8&uo=4","description":"I’m a ex-smoker myself, I know how hard it is to quit smoking and to stay clean.

Meditation gets the brain to relax and reduces the excess of its activity. \n\n\n\nMost smokers know that tobacco is bad for their health; if they don’t quit, it´s because they don´t have the necessary means and tools to say no. \n\n\n\nMeditation and Mindfulness will provide the necessary resources to quit smoking \n\n\n\nAdaptable to new iPhone 5 and iPad Mini \n\n\n\nThis application will help you to: \n\nGain the willpower necessary to avoid tobacco\n\nCalm down before smoking so your anxiety doesn´t control you.\n\nBecome aware of how disgusting tobacco smoke is (something the smoker has forgotten over time)\n\nAvoid automation of smoking; you will quit smoking in “auto pilot”\n\n\n\nScientific studies:\n\n\"Meditate daily for 8 weeks make significant changes in brain regions associated with memory, wellbeing and stress. \" - Sara Lazar, Massachusetts General Hospital (United States) \n\n\"Through meditating, we are able to improve our well-beings and quality of life.\" - Dr. Britta Hölzel \n\n\"If we want to be truly happy, we must learn to exercise our brains regulary\"- Richard Davidson, professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin in Madison","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/a3/a7/0e/a3a70ee2-796d-c621-2733-33b5a42ea994/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","ZH","ES","ZH"],"size":"47058944","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2013-04-12T01:27:22Z","updated":"2013-08-15T22:26:44Z","version":"2.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":480768661,"developer":"Hector Rodriguez Fornies","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hector-rodriguez-fornies/id480768661?uo=4","currentVersionScore":1.5,"currentVersionReviews":2,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/eb/c6/01/ebc60167-33a0-dae0-db5e-5b1d581e97f5/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/df/d8/c3/dfd8c3e6-e777-9828-784d-9c2933713ffb/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/fb/5e/c6/fb5ec62e-b2fe-c640-382a-9956f07b42eb/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fa/90/78/fa907878-0d25-893c-a202-86a90ace5eec/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/41/f0/f3/41f0f397-f8d7-76da-5439-752f6cacd3dc/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/cb/de/7f/cbde7fc9-bdb1-c96f-1f6b-9242491c1082/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/ae/76/d3ae76bb-19f1-7cad-d991-ea205ed8560b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/37/c0/ae/37c0ae24-9d14-d1c0-e6e3-7b6af159f638/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e5/da/ef/e5daefb8-f555-a88f-e7d4-e8e49b572a83/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/fd/ed/d3fdede3-0f44-9774-7f52-452d59703eb4/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":560446511,"appId":"com.snappademics.smokefree","title":"3-2-1 Quit Smoking Now!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/3-2-1-quit-smoking-now!/id560446511?mt=8&uo=4","description":"3-2-1 Quit Smoking Now!

There are only 2 simple steps:\n\n1) Watch the short opening video\n2) Listen to the two 1 hour audio sessions\n\nThat’s it, you are now FREE - it's that easy!  Extra BONUS material includes:\n\n* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom\n\n* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the \"5 day adjustment period\"\n\n* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for life\n\nJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”\n\nJason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”\n\nAppdiction Review:\n\n\"Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.\"","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"349286400","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2012-01-23T04:33:18Z","updated":"2016-01-08T23:40:59Z","version":"2.1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":493242642,"developer":"Juice Master","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.juicemaster.com/Stop-Smoking-in-2-hours","score":4.5,"reviews":24,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":7,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":458916516,"appId":"com.KeatsPascoe.No-Smoking","title":"The Best No Smoking App","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-best-no-smoking-app/id458916516?mt=8&uo=4","description":"No Smoking is an app made for anyone who is having troubles breaking their habit.  No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.  You will hardly notice you've cut back until you've quit.  There is also a motivation and tip section for when you are feeling weak or you are slipping off your schedule.  The app also keeps track of some very interesting statistics including averages, maximums, minimums, saved money, saved tar and nicotine levels and more.  Even if you aren't ready to quit, get this app and run it for a while, then check the stats and you may just change your mind.\n\n- keep track of money, smokes, nicotine and more\n- quit at your own pace with many options to tailor to your situation\n- manually add or remove smokes for when you forget\n- motivation and tips for when you are feeling weak","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e2/91/23/e291236c-2220-af5d-df62-be5851baef12/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"3641344","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2011-09-13T22:25:56Z","updated":"2014-04-20T02:27:56Z","version":"2.3.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":375591377,"developer":"Snappy Appz Inc.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/snappy-appz-inc./id375591377?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://snappyappz.com","currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/85/3b/98/853b9830-e56f-c312-cff7-ccddf41aa3bd/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/a3/4e/daa34ee5-ab5d-db26-d9e6-ec5daeb1608c/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a1/ae/40/a1ae4065-e404-8bf1-02f7-a2fc6d99d730/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/68/53/3a/68533ad2-819b-a62e-228c-fcdfe82cc7e7/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":968824591,"appId":"com.myh.quitnet","title":"QuitNet: Stop smoking and quit nicotine for life","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quitnet-stop-smoking-quit/id968824591?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Don’t quit alone.

What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nStop Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Stop Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nStop Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Stop Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nStop smoking now to avoid insurance hikes.

Non-smokers don’t buy cigarettes, nor do they\nsmoke.\n\nTo see permanent change on the outside, you must first create the change of belief on the inside.

They use willpower to stop themselves from smoking but don’t change the “program” and self-image that makes them want to smoke.\n\nThe main premise of this program is to create the behavior and belief that you DO NOT want to smoke, and reinforce that in your subconscious. You will find this method of changing your belief about cigarettes to be amazingly simple, yet incredibly empowering.\n\nBottom Line...It Works!!!\n\nLite Version includes: 1 Hypnosis Session & 1 Background Music Track.\n\nUPGRADE:\n\nIf you like the sound quality, the ability to create your own custom hypnosis session with multiple sound playback and overall ease of use, you'll love the full version of My Hypnosis Custom Non Smoker.\n\nThe full version of My Hypnosis Custom Non Smoker includes: 5 different hypnosis\ntracks along with 4 choices of background music or no music at all.

After 80 engaging minutes “in the company of” Allen Carr – you will gain the key to set yourself free.\n\nWhatever you do – DO NOT STOP SMOKING before you have viewed this entire app. Given that you’re planning to stop smoking - being told to “carry on” for a little longer is probably a little confusing…but no doubt music to your ears. \n\nAt this point you’re probably finding the concept of it being “easy to stop smoking” a little hard to believe but all we ask is that you progress through this app, carry on smoking, and follow the instructions. When you are ready to have your final cigarette you’ll understand why Allen Carr’s Easyway method has sold more than 14 MILLION books worldwide almost entirely on the strength of word of mouth; it works!\n\nWhether you are a chainsmoker, an occasional smoker, a cigar or pipe smoker, young or old, or whether you’re using e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or any other nicotine product this app can set you free. If you haven’t smoked in the past few days – there is no need to do so – other than that – please do carry on smoking as normal while you make your way through this app.\n\nAN ADDED BONUS\n\nThis app is proudly supported by Allen Carr’s worldwide network of stop smoking clinics. If at any stage during or after the use of this app you have any questions or concerns or require additional guidance you are very welcome to contact your nearest Allen Carr’s Easyway Clinic for free of charge advice. A link to the clinics is included in the app.\nAllen Carr’s Easyway is the most successful stop-smoking method of all time. It has helped millions of smokers from all over the world quit\n\n•instantly \n•easily \n•painlessly\n•permanently\n\nAllen Carr’s Easyway does not require willpower as it removes your desire to smoke. It eliminates the fears that keep you hooked and you won’t miss cigarettes. There are no gimmicks or scare tactics, you won’t put on weight, and you continue to smoke while you watch.\n\nIF YOU FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS IT IS EASY TO BECOME A HAPPY NON-SMOKER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE\n\nSound issues?\n\nWe have investigated this thoroughly and found no technical sound issues with the app. However, some devices use the ‘side switch’ to either lock the screen orientation or to mute sounds. This is customisable in the settings on your device and has been the solution for many of the reported sound issues. Thanks for your continued support and patience!\n\n\n“Allen Carr explodes the myth that giving up smoking is difficult.” – The Times\n\n “A different approach. A stunning success.” – The Sun\n\n “Allow Allen Carr to help you escape painlessly today.” – The Observer\n\n“His method is absolutely unique, removing the dependence on cigarettes.” – Sir Richard Branson\n\n“I was really impressed by the method. In spite of the success and fame of Allen Carr’s Easyway, there were no gimmicks and the professional was something a GP could readily respect. I would be happy to give a medical endorsement of the method to anyone.” – Dr PM Bray MB, CHb, MRCGP\n\n“Instantly I was freed from my addiction. I found it not only easy but unbelievably enjoyable to stay stopped.” – Sir Anthony Hopkins\n\n“Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking program achieved for me a thing that I thought was not possible – to give up a thirty-year smoking habit literally overnight.

How about finally joining the ranks of real NONSMOKERS and really quit without the agony from cravings.  \n\nYou already know that you spend too much on your unhealthy habit.  What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nQuit Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Quit Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nQuit Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nQuit smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Quit Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.  Download the Quit Smoking App & get started with the first session for free! The install is free, with no obligation, nothing to lose, and so much to gain.\nDownload and install Quit Smoking!","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/a0/8b/b8/a08bb8ab-75bf-c1aa-1f0d-c300b04c02a7/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Productivity"],"genreIds":["6013","6007"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"20230144","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2014-05-30T03:53:34Z","updated":"2015-01-06T19:32:15Z","version":"1.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":467457672,"developer":"AB Mobile Apps LLC.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ab-mobile-apps-llc./id467457672?uo=4","screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/79/b0/48/79b04870-b669-4bad-2884-be853d6410d7/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/07/00/22/0700224f-e97a-1aca-8aa6-361bcb3bee1d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/94/18/ad/9418adf2-854b-b73e-281d-992d4266bca4/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/d7/e8/30/d7e830fb-3a3b-b4ba-43db-e497f5ab92e1/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/b3/f2/95/b3f2959f-b014-879a-ef11-38860f0e8f4d/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/de/9b/6a/de9b6a41-1f6d-0c50-7647-903eb2b338b1/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/79/60/69/79606905-7d6b-d9ad-b011-c33e9efd779e/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d5/ca/74/d5ca744a-0ef6-574d-3a8a-71535c643a1a/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/ed/98/0d/ed980d38-4f8e-28a4-522a-15cb94fb1dfd/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":938009829,"appId":"com.vapeboss.vapeboss","title":"Vape Boss","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vape-boss/id938009829?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Vape Boss is the most comprehensive Vape resource ever created!

But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way.\n \nTim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way.\n \nPart One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking.\n \nPart Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why. \n \nPart Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation.\n \nPart Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again.\n \nYour progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing.

He eliminates the fears that keep you hooked and you won’t miss cigarettes. There are no gimmicks or scare tactics, you won’t put on weight, and you can continue to smoke while you watch!\n\nWhatever you do – DO NOT STOP SMOKING before you have viewed this entire app. Given that you’re planning to stop smoking - being told to “carry on” for a little longer is probably a little confusing…but no doubt music to your ears. \n\nAt this point you’re probably finding the concept of it being “easy to stop smoking” a little hard to believe but all we ask is that you progress through this app, carry on smoking, and follow the instructions. When you are ready to have your final cigarette you’ll understand why Allen Carr’s Easyway method has sold more than 15 MILLION books worldwide almost entirely on the strength of word of mouth; it works!\n\nWhether you are a chainsmoker, an occasional smoker, a cigar or pipe smoker, young or old, or whether you’re using e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or any other nicotine product this app can set you free. If you haven’t smoked in the past few days – there is no need to do so – other than that – please do carry on smoking as normal while you make your way through this app.\n\nAN ADDED BONUS\n\nThis app is proudly supported by Allen Carr’s worldwide network of stop smoking clinics. If at any stage during or after the use of this app you have any questions or concerns or require additional guidance you are very welcome to contact your nearest Allen Carr’s Easyway Clinic for free of charge advice. A link to the clinics is included in the app.\n\nAllen Carr’s Easyway is the most successful stop-smoking method of all time. It has helped millions of smokers from all over the world quit\n\n• instantly \n• easily \n• painlessly\n• permanently\n\nIF YOU FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS IT IS EASY TO BECOME A HAPPY NON-SMOKER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE\n\n“Allen Carr explodes the myth that giving up smoking is difficult.” – The Times\n\n“A different approach. A stunning success.” – The Sun\n\n“Allow Allen Carr to help you escape painlessly today.” – The Observer\n\n“His method is absolutely unique, removing the dependence on cigarettes.” – Sir Richard Branson\n\n“I was really impressed by the method. In spite of the success and fame of Allen Carr’s Easyway, there were no gimmicks and the professional was something a GP could readily respect. I would be happy to give a medical endorsement of the method to anyone.” – Dr PM Bray MB, CHb, MRCGP\n\n“Instantly I was freed from my addiction. I found it not only easy but unbelievably enjoyable to stay stopped.” – Sir Anthony Hopkins\n\n“Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking program achieved for me a thing that I thought was not possible – to give up a thirty-year smoking habit literally overnight. It was nothing short of a miracle.” – Anjelica Huston\n\nNote: This application uses GPS to identify your country. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple60/v4/bd/4a/6e/bd4a6ed7-882d-2a3d-2ccf-3ef2149a6ab2/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN","DE"],"size":"20790272","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2015-01-11T19:03:16Z","updated":"2016-05-13T01:14:56Z","version":"3.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":585624867,"developer":"Arcturus Digital LTD","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/arcturus-digital-ltd/id585624867?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.easywaypublishing.com/","screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/95/9a/eb/959aeb0a-29ea-14a9-0420-99a5b93f4935/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e0/84/46/e0844642-292a-af29-3e55-c15f298af455/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/07/15/12/071512d5-b73a-0ba1-26af-5a6ff865ac49/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/16/c6/e9/16c6e9ed-283f-f486-3aa0-c33ef39eba93/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/08/96/14/0896144a-91f6-6dae-c7b6-9231ce11b6cc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/15/50/2f/15502f02-9481-be24-5a9a-2c7731246ae1/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/3b/d0/f6/3bd0f63f-e8a5-03f4-6e96-dc8edcfd9184/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e6/f6/21/e6f621e5-7966-f7e1-7a7d-f8f911277cda/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/f3/0b/a2/f30ba292-b9ce-cddd-755f-0cd71525526d/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/9e/3c/f3/9e3cf3be-ed66-8962-9d3c-86ef8fe8d9a0/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":1096542213,"appId":"com.NoSmokingCalendar.scope","title":"No Smoking Calendar - Stop smoking cigarettes and stop smoking tobacco","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/no-smoking-calendar-stop-smoking/id1096542213?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Tobacco addiction among men is on the rise.

Just take one day at a time and look forward to the new you without Tobacco in your life. Not only will this app help you stop smoking, but it will help you become more social.\n\nTop 10 reasons to quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco:\n\n1. You smell like smoke constantly\n\nNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!\n\n2. You age quicker\n\nYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!\n\n3. Your sense of smell and taste decline\n\nBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. \n\n4. Your social network\n\nBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!\n\n5. Smaller dating pool\n\nAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.\n\n6. Impotence\n\nSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. \n\n7. Chances of infection are increased\n\nFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.\n\n8. Dangers to others\n\nSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?\n\n9. Decreased physical activity\n\nMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved. Smoking causes the lungs and heart to work harder, which decreases cardiovascular abilities. \n\n10. Cost of smoking cigarettes \n\nJust on cigarettes alone, the average smoker can spend $3,000 a year on cigarettes. If that isn’t enough to sway your opinion, think about the well being risks that you will inevitably be paying for down the road.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/4f/24/90/4f249088-aa14-5b22-592d-462930a2f322/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"50624512","requiredOsVersion":"8.1","released":"2016-04-01T03:06:55Z","updated":"2016-04-01T03:06:55Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":953610384,"developer":"App Diggity, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://appdiggity.com","screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/bc/52/9a/bc529a7d-6016-c9c1-c838-7bf2f5f2faed/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/79/a9/b7/79a9b76f-6780-ae0c-9cf7-2e262285c5e8/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2a/d6/8e/2ad68e70-bdb6-8bf6-3b77-b53be2f2540a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/73/79/83/7379836d-c236-740a-e36a-3f87009c6df0/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ef/50/9e/ef509e18-b6e4-752a-fe3f-5e5576ffddc4/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ba/03/e5/ba03e579-69de-97b3-df33-227994c03bd2/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/83/b1/e8/83b1e821-2cc3-7928-c29b-aff65644a046/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2b/10/7f/2b107f26-f410-9a37-deb2-d8307902b491/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b8/3a/5c/b83a5c58-0200-60b1-bc5e-b8ab4123116c/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/fc/69/db/fc69db8f-f5b0-c389-2a85-f89545e1b45f/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":425705079,"appId":"it.albertobonetti.motivator","title":"Motivator - Stop Smoking with your personal motivator!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motivator-stop-smoking-your/id425705079?mt=8&uo=4","description":"How many times have you tried to quit smoking? \n\nIt's the right time to succeed, here is the right app!\n\nStudies show that smokers who have someone to provide support, are more successful in giving up cigarettes than smokers who try to quit on their own.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? \nChoose your personal motivator to support you and stay focused on your goal! \nIt is easier to be successful if you are not alone and someone trusts you and supports you when it would be difficult endure.\n\nTrack your progress on the calendar and take a look to your daily improvement.\nIt will be rewarding to see the little \"super\" star!\nYou can visualize and share with friends the progresses that you are making. \n\nIf your personal motivators and the progress list are not enough for you, take a look at the list of the best reasons to stop smoking: it will help you to stay focused and to achieve your goal.\n\nCome on!

This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.\nHypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.\nHypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.\nAnd the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.\nSo it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.\nIt may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.\nTwo days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.\nLong term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.\nIn the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12333056","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-10-16T12:37:44Z","version":"2.0","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":335619213,"developer":"iCan Hypnosis","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ican-hypnosis.com/","score":3.5,"reviews":35,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":924784747,"appId":"com.healthiertennessee.streaks","title":"Streaks for Small Starts — Create healthy habits","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streaks-for-small-starts-create/id924784747?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Trying to get healthier can feel overwhelming, but Streaks for Small Starts changes that.

Glenn is one of the world's best-selling hypnotherapists with multi-million sales of his Apps, CDs, MP3s and 7 self-help books.\n\nGlenn was a regular 20-a-day smoker until he quit forever in 1987 and he understands the smoking habit from personal experience. He has created these two unique hypnosis recordings to help you to become a non-smoker by reprogramming your unconscious mind. This way, being a non-smoker will feel completely normal and natural to you. \n\nOn both hypnosis audio tracks you will be safely guided into a very deep state of mental and physical relaxation and then given multiple post-hypnotic suggestions that you don't smoke, and that you will remain a non-smoker forever. Glenn's utilises his skilled hypnotherapy techniques to help you break all past associations with smoking, which completely removes the struggle from stopping smoking. You will also be given positive suggestions and affirmations to prevent you from putting on weight or substituting any other negative patterns of behaviour in place of the smoking habit. In fact when you stop smoking your motivation and desire to keep fit and healthy will become stronger than ever. \n\nQuitting Smoking is easy with hypnotherapy, as this method is uniquely effective in programming the mind to overcome the addiction to cigarettes and nicotine. Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques and production will help you achieve this goal in a safe and natural way. \n\nThis App Includes:\n\nHypnosis Audio Tracks\n• Stop Smoking Now 31:31 mins\n• Stop Smoking Forever 28:22 mins\n• 12 Minute Sleep Booster\n\neBooks by Glenn Harrold\n• De-Stress - The 8 Golden Rules\n• The Ultimate Guide To Self Hypnosis\n• How To Use This App\n• About The Author\n\nStop Smoking features two powerful hypnotherapy sessions containing:\n• Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques guiding you into a deep state of mental and physical relaxation.\n• The very latest state-of-the-art recording technology.\n• Background sound effects recorded in specific musical keys and frequencies to compliment the hypnotic suggestions and enhance the deep trance effect.\n• Hypnotic echoed backing vocals panning from left to right across the stereo range - a unique hypnotic effect.\n• Powerful subliminal suggestions embedded under the fade out music to maximise the overall effectiveness of the recordings.\n\nGlenn has over 20 years experience as a full-time hypnotherapist and works with many celebrity clients.

Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it’s done.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/95/82/1d/95821d7a-b10f-8336-6c98-7cead1e2af00/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN","DE","ES"],"size":"82685952","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2013-02-27T00:23:13Z","updated":"2016-10-16T20:36:19Z","version":"3.3.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":577767595,"developer":"David Crane","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/david-crane/id577767595?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://smokefreeapp.com/","score":4.5,"reviews":1414,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":16,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/84/a9/90/84a9907d-5910-4904-a6ff-07352a3ea03a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple20/v4/b8/61/0e/b8610e99-4277-bc3b-3a11-ccf1b0f6e845/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple18/v4/f7/20/56/f72056d1-6d5a-c8c9-e3da-a8be8a2871e8/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple18/v4/89/7a/56/897a56a9-d64f-e525-dab9-a09a16e7eb61/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple30/v4/d7/2e/1c/d72e1c0c-6222-5383-4bf1-b3dc30c6e715/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":468624531,"appId":"com.digitalsirup.QuitItLite","title":"Quit It Lite - stop smoking today","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-it-lite-stop-smoking/id468624531?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Quit It is a tiny motivating program, supporting and encouraging smokers to quit smoking and helping ex-smokers to stay quit. \n\nIt keeps track of the cigarettes you did not smoke and how much money you are saving.

Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. \n\nIf you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. \n\nLet's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: \n\n1). \"Quit Smoking- Preparation\" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)\n\nListen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. \n\n2). \"Smoking Cessation\" \n\nYou will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. \n\n3). \"Smoke-Free Sleep Track\" \n\nStart listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! \n\n4). \"Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster\" \n\nThis short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes. Listen to this to address any cravings that may come up, for any situations that may have triggered you to smoke in the past, and to quickly reinforce your reasons for releasing cigarettes and smoking from your life. \n\nWe've worked hard to build the absolute best \"Quit Smoking\" hypnosis program in the world.\n\nEnter the world of Mindifi.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/e4/a9/ce/e4a9ce0e-45f0-8234-cd31-30bceb26c45a/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6020","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"127901696","requiredOsVersion":"5.0","released":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","updated":"2013-12-07T01:08:06Z","version":"1.3","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":570601283,"developer":"Mindifi LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mindifi-llc/id570601283?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://mindifi.com","score":4,"reviews":12,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":5,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/ce/b7/c5/ceb7c57b-cab0-a81f-3db2-624bf08d0cc3/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/33/82/fd/3382fdaf-77c9-8eb6-866b-abe1277d168e/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/dd/a4/37/dda4377c-e8b1-1c85-f8d5-e8502a9808ba/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/1a/c1/51/1ac151db-cee4-f1ef-f192-8b584b459b65/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ec/96/92/ec969223-c6cc-5776-1632-33a5d729cf51/screen320x320.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/58/cf/6b/58cf6b5e-9c3d-d1e7-2201-8d4e59bd7a81/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/41/aa/1e/41aa1ec4-2646-ce50-1a4b-0810b99cb069/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/36/2b/5f/362b5f46-968d-763e-abd2-a4d21f83e319/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/e0/08/dae00845-d85c-2a21-8122-40dd50bd7e8c/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c1/58/6a/c1586a16-7481-62d6-6caa-b69fc5b80ec9/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":566086351,"appId":"com.icyspark.kickthehabit","title":"Kick the Habit: Quit Smoking","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kick-the-habit-quit-smoking/id566086351?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Kick the Habit: Quit Smoking has been designed for people who wish to wean themselves off cigarettes over time, or for those that want to quit immediately.\n\nIf you quit smoking immediately then you will still be shown all the relevant data as below, you just won't have any targets to meet.\n\nThe main purpose of Kick the Habit: Quit Smoking however is for those that wish to wean themselves off cigarettes.

Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey.

In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.

Get this application in Low rate for few days only ***\n\nPost your reviews and ratings to serve your better in future.\n\n*******************************\n\nStop smoking is not easy. In our application Quit Smoking Tips you can find tips which may help you to quit smoking.\n\n\nSmokers may have started smoking because their friends did or because it seemed cool. But they keep on smoking because they became addicted to nicotine, one of the chemicals in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n\nNicotine is both a stimulant and a depressant. That means it increases the heart rate at first and makes people feel more alert (like caffeine, another stimulant). Then it causes depression and fatigue. The depression and fatigue and the drug withdrawal from nicotine make people crave another cigarette to perk up again.

This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.\nHypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.\nHypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.\nAnd the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.\nSo it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.\nIt may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.\nTwo days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.\nLong term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.\nIn the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12333056","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-10-16T12:37:44Z","version":"2.0","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":335619213,"developer":"iCan Hypnosis","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ican-hypnosis.com/","score":3.5,"reviews":35,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":1041278718,"appId":"com.GreenSeed.stopsmoke","title":"Stop Smoking app - Quit Cigarette and Smoke Free","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-app-quit-cigarette/id1041278718?mt=8&uo=4","description":"•••It’s over, you quit smoking !

It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better!\n\n4). \"Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster\"\n\nThis short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes.

The Filters are completely safe, vapor-free, and made in the USA.\n\nWe at UCLA, and formerly Q-Cigarettes, Inc., truly believe that our App will be an incredibly valuable tool for Quitters and Supporters to fight against tobacco smoking.

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.\n\nBy using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, \ne.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We \ncan also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["DA","NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PL","PT","RU","ES","SV"],"size":"40623684","requiredOsVersion":"4.3","released":"2010-02-02T22:13:22Z","updated":"2012-08-15T18:56:27Z","version":"2.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":344500276,"developer":"On Beat Limited","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://","score":4,"reviews":53,"currentVersionScore":4.5,"currentVersionReviews":22,"screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":1103280169,"appId":"jp.gr.java-conf.earnest.quitsmoking","title":"Enjoy!

It is intended to serve as a source of readily available support and information for adults who are already in treatment to quit smoking - - to help them stay quit even after treatment ends.  The app guides users in creating a tailored plan that takes into account their personal reasons for quitting. It provides information about smoking and quitting, interactive tools to help users cope with urges to smoke, and motivational messages and support contacts to help users stay smoke-free.\n\nStay Quit Coach is based on the smoking treatment manual “Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation: Treatment for Veterans with PTSD,” which was written by Miles McFall and Andrew Saxon in collaboration with David Kalman and Timothy Carmody. This treatment is based on evidence-based clinical practices, and has been shown to double quit rates of military veterans with PTSD. Stay Quit Coach was the result of a collaborative effort among the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD), the VA Sierra Pacific (VISN 21) Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Clinical Public Health Group (CPH) and the Department of Defense National Center for Telehealth & Technology (T2).  Additional partners include the VA Puget Sound Health Care System and Northwest (VISN 20) MIRECC, and VA Mid-Atlantic (VISN 6) MIRECC.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple2/v4/29/01/a9/2901a914-28d5-1ae3-fd90-6530ca22d9e6/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"6803456","requiredOsVersion":"4.3","released":"2013-05-30T20:50:47Z","updated":"2013-05-30T20:50:47Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":430646305,"developer":"US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/us-department-veterans-affairs/id430646305?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/pages/fslist_mobile_apps.asp","score":5,"reviews":9,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":9,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fe/00/53/fe0053af-f204-adc9-7994-2119d12b9d67/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/f0/b2/be/f0b2beda-99f2-a129-7340-b68653059e17/screen568x568.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/48/9a/19/489a192c-659b-e9e6-20fa-721e43888b17/screen568x568.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/b9/52/0e/b9520e34-70d1-9e6a-4b9c-07aeb2c40792/screen568x568.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/00/0e/71/000e71a9-bce3-813f-756d-3e185e30e0c5/screen568x568.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":576184539,"appId":"EntAndApps.StopSmoke","title":"Quit Smoking Forever","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-forever/id576184539?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Do you want to quit smoking?\n\nHere you have a different solution.\n\nWith this method you stop smoking in an easy way, we're going proposing challenges, and you will get it  gradually.

You can face and work through them in a positive way with Clean Break. \n\nWe know you can’t do this alone.  If you’d like additional support, you can connect with other Clean Break Quit Smoking participants through this app.\n\n“I feel healthy again.  I’ve been starting and stopping my whole life.

I like the community part of this too.  Always someone there to encourage me to get through those rough moments.”\n\n“There are many ways to quit but I’ve found the tried and true way to quit smoking is to be part of a program that provides content and approaches that you’d find in a treatment program.

I have used them in other areas of my life that required intelligent, rational, and responsible choosing.” – Dana\n\nWhen I refer patients and friends to your program, they usually ask me if I really believe that it works. With complete conviction I tell them, “If you want to quit, and you use what Clean Break teaches, you will quit and you will start feeling good about it immediately!” – Thomas, M.D \n\n“The power of nicotine addiction is such that even though I was desperate in the extreme to quit, I was unable to even try. I had failed so many times and in so many ways and was afraid that nothing would work for me. My very thinking was enslaved to the process of justifying my habit and my inability to change my life.”\n\n”Clean Break gave me the tools that have made it possible for me to be able to decide for myself to smoke or not. Six years later those tools are still working. The whole experience has been a great personal success that I measure on a lifetime scale.” – Mike","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple62/v4/0a/9d/3d/0a9d3d96-d6fc-3ec8-0305-7ef5e2766ec8/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"59894784","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2016-10-14T21:20:59Z","updated":"2016-10-14T21:20:59Z","version":"1.0","price":1.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":1164516692,"developer":"Clean Break Online, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/clean-break-online-llc/id1164516692?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://cleanbreakonline.com","currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":3,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/6e/34/ef/6e34ef12-5fb0-89c9-57fc-ac8893d4a65f/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/ed/74/22/ed742200-dc11-94c3-9b18-cdb35d965caa/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/db/ff/57/dbff57f6-12d2-763a-22b7-9136087d3d37/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/63/11/bc/6311bcbd-b0d2-97d3-c068-4d314fe671e1/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/c1/52/49/c1524977-3e09-62eb-38c1-9bcc283770ca/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":885991031,"appId":"info.sedlmeier.smokefree","title":"Smokefree - Quit smoking now!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smokefree-quit-smoking-now!/id885991031?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Want to stop smoking?\n\nSmokefree can help you!\n\nLearn how much money you could already save through your new life as non-smoker.

In our application 'Quit Smoking Secrets' you can find tips which may help you to quit smoking.\n\n\nSmokers may have started smoking because their friends did or because it seemed cool. But they keep on smoking because they became addicted to nicotine, one of the chemicals in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n\nNicotine is both a stimulant and a depressant. That means it increases the heart rate at first and makes people feel more alert (like caffeine, another stimulant). Then it causes depression and fatigue. The depression and fatigue and the drug withdrawal from nicotine make people crave another cigarette to perk up again. According to many experts, the nicotine in tobacco is as addictive as cocaine or heroin.\n\nIt's true, for most people quitting isn't easy. After all, the nicotine in cigarettes is a powerfully addictive drug.

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.\n\nBy using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, \ne.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We \ncan also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["DA","NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PL","PT","RU","ES","SV"],"size":"40623684","requiredOsVersion":"4.3","released":"2010-02-02T22:13:22Z","updated":"2012-08-15T18:56:27Z","version":"2.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":344500276,"developer":"On Beat Limited","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://","score":4,"reviews":53,"currentVersionScore":4.5,"currentVersionReviews":22,"screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":741949277,"appId":"com.surfcityapps.quitsmoking","title":"Quit Smoking Hypnosis - Hypnotherapy to Help Stop Smoking Cigarettes Now","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-hypnosis-hypnotherapy/id741949277?mt=8&uo=4","description":"◉ Learn to reduce cigarette cravings after listening daily for just 1–3 weeks\n◉ Change your mindset through subconscious thoughts to kick the habit\n◉ You won’t have to try to quit smoking — it just happens naturally!\n\nTRAIN YOUR MIND TO HELP YOU QUIT SMOKING THROUGH HYPNOSIS\n\nDo you want to quit, but just haven’t been able to start?

Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. \n\nIf you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. \n\nLet's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: \n\n1). \"Quit Smoking- Preparation\" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)\n\nListen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. \n\n2). \"Smoking Cessation\" \n\nYou will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. \n\n3). \"Smoke-Free Sleep Track\" \n\nStart listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! \n\n4). \"Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster\" \n\nThis short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes. Listen to this to address any cravings that may come up, for any situations that may have triggered you to smoke in the past, and to quickly reinforce your reasons for releasing cigarettes and smoking from your life. \n\nWe've worked hard to build the absolute best \"Quit Smoking\" hypnosis program in the world.\n\nEnter the world of Mindifi.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/e4/a9/ce/e4a9ce0e-45f0-8234-cd31-30bceb26c45a/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6020","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"127901696","requiredOsVersion":"5.0","released":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","updated":"2013-12-07T01:08:06Z","version":"1.3","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":570601283,"developer":"Mindifi LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mindifi-llc/id570601283?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://mindifi.com","score":4,"reviews":12,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":5,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/ce/b7/c5/ceb7c57b-cab0-a81f-3db2-624bf08d0cc3/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/33/82/fd/3382fdaf-77c9-8eb6-866b-abe1277d168e/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/dd/a4/37/dda4377c-e8b1-1c85-f8d5-e8502a9808ba/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/1a/c1/51/1ac151db-cee4-f1ef-f192-8b584b459b65/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ec/96/92/ec969223-c6cc-5776-1632-33a5d729cf51/screen320x320.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/58/cf/6b/58cf6b5e-9c3d-d1e7-2201-8d4e59bd7a81/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/41/aa/1e/41aa1ec4-2646-ce50-1a4b-0810b99cb069/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/36/2b/5f/362b5f46-968d-763e-abd2-a4d21f83e319/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/e0/08/dae00845-d85c-2a21-8122-40dd50bd7e8c/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c1/58/6a/c1586a16-7481-62d6-6caa-b69fc5b80ec9/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":430789660,"appId":"com.freetheapps.stopsmoking","title":"The Painless Stop Smoking Cure","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/painless-stop-smoking-cure/id430789660?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Are you tired of trying and failing to stop smoking by using bogus pills, sprays, gum,\npatches, laser therapy, hypnosis or cheap stop smoking apps?\n\nThis FREE app introduces you to the revolutionary Painless Stop Smoking Cure\nfrom Stop Smoking Guru Eric Eraly.

Meditation can be the help and support that you need to quit that habit. \n\n\n\nA Yale University research study confirms the benefits of Mindfulness and mediation when it comes to quitting an addiction.  \n\nThe research shows that 30% of people who practice meditation to quit smoking did not smoke a single cigarette in the first week of training, versus the 6% of people who used traditional methods to quit smoking.\n\n\n\nAn addicted brain is a brain with a great load of stress; it´s a brain that works too fast. Meditation gets the brain to relax and reduces the excess of its activity. \n\n\n\nMost smokers know that tobacco is bad for their health; if they don’t quit, it´s because they don´t have the necessary means and tools to say no. \n\n\n\nMeditation and Mindfulness will provide the necessary resources to quit smoking \n\n\n\nAdaptable to new iPhone 5 and iPad Mini \n\n\n\nThis application will help you to: \n\nGain the willpower necessary to avoid tobacco\n\nCalm down before smoking so your anxiety doesn´t control you.\n\nBecome aware of how disgusting tobacco smoke is (something the smoker has forgotten over time)\n\nAvoid automation of smoking; you will quit smoking in “auto pilot”\n\n\n\nScientific studies:\n\n\"Meditate daily for 8 weeks make significant changes in brain regions associated with memory, wellbeing and stress. \" - Sara Lazar, Massachusetts General Hospital (United States) \n\n\"Through meditating, we are able to improve our well-beings and quality of life.\" - Dr. Britta Hölzel \n\n\"If we want to be truly happy, we must learn to exercise our brains regulary\"- Richard Davidson, professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin in Madison","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/a3/a7/0e/a3a70ee2-796d-c621-2733-33b5a42ea994/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","ZH","ES","ZH"],"size":"47058944","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2013-04-12T01:27:22Z","updated":"2013-08-15T22:26:44Z","version":"2.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":480768661,"developer":"Hector Rodriguez Fornies","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hector-rodriguez-fornies/id480768661?uo=4","currentVersionScore":1.5,"currentVersionReviews":2,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/eb/c6/01/ebc60167-33a0-dae0-db5e-5b1d581e97f5/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/df/d8/c3/dfd8c3e6-e777-9828-784d-9c2933713ffb/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/fb/5e/c6/fb5ec62e-b2fe-c640-382a-9956f07b42eb/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fa/90/78/fa907878-0d25-893c-a202-86a90ace5eec/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/41/f0/f3/41f0f397-f8d7-76da-5439-752f6cacd3dc/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/cb/de/7f/cbde7fc9-bdb1-c96f-1f6b-9242491c1082/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/ae/76/d3ae76bb-19f1-7cad-d991-ea205ed8560b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/37/c0/ae/37c0ae24-9d14-d1c0-e6e3-7b6af159f638/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e5/da/ef/e5daefb8-f555-a88f-e7d4-e8e49b572a83/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/fd/ed/d3fdede3-0f44-9774-7f52-452d59703eb4/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":493242639,"appId":"com.juicemaster.stopSmokingIn2Hours","title":"Stop Smoking In 2 Hours","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-in-2-hours/id493242639?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Don't just quit for a month... Stop Smoking For Life in just 2 hours! NOW COMPLETELY FREE! NO PURCHASE REQUIRED!\n\nOver 2 MILLION Jason Vale books sold worldwide and creator of the No.1 BEST-SELLING APP '7lbs in 7 Days: super juice diet’ *\n\nSTOP SMOKING IN 2 HOURS requires NO WILLPOWER...NO GUMS OR PATCHES...NO GIMMICKS... Just a Simple Way to Freedom.\n\nAddiction and health author Jason Vale ran a \"Stop Smoking\" clinic for 9 years and successfully helped thousands of people to become smoke-free.  Jason used to smoke 40-60 cigarettes a day himself, until he learnt the secret to stopping in 1995, and hasn’t smoked since! Now, YOU can learn Jason’s secret from his tried and tested programme from the convenience of your own iPhone / iPod / iPad. Jason is literally in your pocket every step of the way!\n\nStop Smoking in Just 2 hours and remain Free for Life!  There are only 2 simple steps:\n\n1) Watch the short opening video\n2) Listen to the two 1 hour audio sessions\n\nThat’s it, you are now FREE - it's that easy!  Extra BONUS material includes:\n\n* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom\n\n* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the \"5 day adjustment period\"\n\n* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for life\n\nJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”\n\nJason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”\n\nAppdiction Review:\n\n\"Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.\"","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"349286400","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2012-01-23T04:33:18Z","updated":"2016-01-08T23:40:59Z","version":"2.1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":493242642,"developer":"Juice Master","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.juicemaster.com/Stop-Smoking-in-2-hours","score":4.5,"reviews":24,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":7,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":951148043,"appId":"com.abma.free.stopsmoking","title":"Stop Smoking: A free quit smoking program","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-free-quit-smoking/id951148043?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Stop Smoking today and get started for FREE with the Stop Smoking app\n\nThe Stop Smoking app incorporates proven methods and then super charges them with this mobile app to help you quit smoking now!\n\nThe one of a kind Stop Smoking app uses state of the art technology to help you quit smoking and stay a Nonsmoker.  \n\nWith features such as:\n\n•A step by step quit smoking program\n•A daily quit smoking agenda\n•Personalized notifications that help you succeed\n•One of a kind analysis on your smoking habits and behaviors with recommended course of actions \n•An integrated tracker that helps you know how much money you have saved and spent on cigarettes. \n•A daily activity or action \n•Unique social system to help you quit with a friend\n•A conversation forum to connect with other people who have quit smoking\n•Reasons to quit with helpful reminders\n•Notes section to help track your progress and document you your habits\n•One of a kind quit smoking assignment system\n•Quit Smoking Session System\n\nStart quitting today with the Stop Smoking app, Download for FREE today!\n\nReady to quit AGAIN?

But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way.\n \nTim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way.\n \nPart One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking.\n \nPart Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why. \n \nPart Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation.\n \nPart Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again.\n \nYour progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing. You’ll be amazed by how quickly you start to enjoy the benefits of being a non-smoker.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/77/3f/2f/773f2fcf-8fcb-1ce9-4854-cb1ca783d27a/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"46960640","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2014-11-25T14:11:40Z","updated":"2015-06-30T02:16:24Z","version":"1.2.2","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":930436697,"developer":"The Stop Switch","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-stop-switch/id930436697?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.thestopswitch.com","screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/60/bf/58/60bf58a0-f8db-e981-8afd-ff78deb496d7/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/74/58/c5/7458c53b-844a-6ecc-d865-3b3079c7de1b/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d8/db/8d/d8db8d93-a790-8a86-319a-2bc3e2ccd5b5/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/6c/1f/60/6c1f60c6-0751-3406-4b3a-ea0c8df54df6/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/bf/e8/85/bfe8850a-7d98-27f0-4ba2-75d75d6fa113/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":480714652,"appId":"com.lauruss.nonSmokerLite","title":"My Hypnosis Stop Smoking Lite Version","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-hypnosis-stop-smoking-lite/id480714652?mt=8&uo=4","description":"“My Hypnosis Apps are simply the best customizable hypnosis applications available for your iPhone or iPod Touch.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*****Get this FREE Non Smoking Hypnosis Session for all frustrated smokers out\nthere*****\n\nMy Hypnosis™ Healthy Non Smoker Session will change your views of yourself at the\ncore level.

How about finally joining the ranks of real NONSMOKERS and really quit without the agony from cravings.  \n\nYou already know that you spend too much on your unhealthy habit.  What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nQuit Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Quit Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nQuit Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nQuit smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Quit Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.

Not only will this app help you stop smoking, but it will help you become more social.\n\nTop 10 reasons to quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco:\n\n1. You smell like smoke constantly\n\nNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!\n\n2. You age quicker\n\nYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!\n\n3. Your sense of smell and taste decline\n\nBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. \n\n4. Your social network\n\nBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!\n\n5. Smaller dating pool\n\nAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.\n\n6. Impotence\n\nSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. \n\n7. Chances of infection are increased\n\nFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.\n\n8. Dangers to others\n\nSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?\n\n9. Decreased physical activity\n\nMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved.

This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.\nHypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.\nHypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.\nAnd the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.\nSo it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.\nIt may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.\nTwo days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.\nLong term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.\nIn the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12333056","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-10-16T12:37:44Z","version":"2.0","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":335619213,"developer":"iCan Hypnosis","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ican-hypnosis.com/","score":3.5,"reviews":35,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":661991795,"appId":"com.t3apps.stopsmokingfree","title":"Stop Smoking.

Save your lungs and mind","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/no-marijuana-calendar-stop/id1104097762?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Marijuana addiction among young adults is on the rise. With Marijuana being so readily available, it is no surprise that not many people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. The No Marijuana Calendar can help you put an end to your Marijuana addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your addiction to Marijuana. \n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your Marijuana addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about Marijuana addiction, and reasons to quit.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nSmoking Marijuana overloads your serotonin receptors and decreases your motivation to meet new people. This can destroy your life if you let it. Don't let Marijuana addiction get the best of you. Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.\n\nTake a look at our top 10 reasons to quit marijuana:\n\n1. You will have a clear mind \n\nFor many lifelong smokers, this is the number one reason to quit smoking. If you are finding yourself forgetting simple things and having your mind in a fog for several hours to days after smoking, then quitting marijuana might be the right thing to do.  \n\n2. Being Ambitious  \n\nMany people with bright futures have reported that marijuana use destroys their ambition. They come up with interesting ideas when they are high, but don't have the motivation to push through when the time comes. They end up being very complacent and don't live up to their full potential. \n\n3. Being Energetic \n\nAs you age, marijuana starts to take a toll on your body in many ways. Smoking pot to overcome mundane tasks is why you may have started in the first place, but after a while, your lungs will start to clog and your blood flow will slow.  \n\n4. Having better eating habits \n\nEveryone knows that smoking marijuana speeds up your metabolism, which in turn makes you very hungry. This is commonly known as the munchies. No matter what type of foods you are eating, you are still putting a damper on your overall health and digestive tract. \n\n5. Having clean lungs \n\nThere has been conflicting research about the negative effects of smoking weed, but the unanimous agreement is that you are still inhaling smoke. Chronic use can lead to emphysema, cancer, and other serious health issues. \n6. Living life by the laws \n\nThe longer you smoke weed, the more chances you have of running into trouble with the law. Sure, the growing trend of legalization makes us more brazen about marijuana smoking, but possession is still illegal in most states and STILL a federal crime no matter what.  \n\n7. Personal safety \n\nIs your drug dealer really your friend? He may appear to be, but somewhere along his supply chain, there is some serious illegal activity going on. People who engage in illegal activity are more likely to commit violent crimes which you don't want to be caught in the middle of. \n\n8. Save your money \n\nI think this goes without saying! Good marijuana is expensive these days, and according to TIME magazine, the average marijuana smoker spends $1800 a year on weed (About $35 a week). That saved money can go to a better cause. \n\n9. Social life \n\nMost marijuana users start out smoking as a social activity, but more often than not, they end up smoking alone without anyone around. We end up avoiding friends, family, and social gatherings because of the paranoia we feel while high.\n\n10. Better self esteem \n\nPsychological research suggests that heavy marijuana use can lead to depression and anxiety. Marijuana users will normally start smoking to alleviate some sort of pain in their life whether it is physical or emotional.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/0b/10/fa/0b10fa17-e0ba-2b55-5c85-20b5291a78ba/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"50759680","requiredOsVersion":"8.1","released":"2016-04-21T16:09:50Z","updated":"2016-04-21T16:09:50Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":953610384,"developer":"App Diggity, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://appdiggity.com","screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/8c/02/c2/8c02c2ca-b307-c62c-ce8a-a1b8557a2abf/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/69/be/38/69be38d9-5a44-cc8d-6e8a-2ed1950206ef/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/24/8e/5d/248e5d53-e52c-5ace-93ba-75de47a479b6/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/eb/d8/8e/ebd88e8d-751d-b59b-5b31-0bf3ae75675d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/f1/45/e1/f145e127-5eac-25de-da49-59aa7df1d6a1/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/56/f4/05/56f40596-17d5-0756-d9a3-27fc935b883d/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/25/a2/17/25a2170b-85b7-036a-43eb-aee7be076a81/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3f/1f/13/3f1f135c-7815-cc8c-f859-bb49c3991ed7/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/b6/b8/bb/b6b8bb49-339f-1f3d-4221-b11baf533c2a/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/cc/b3/94/ccb39497-eee3-6c35-81b9-b1ac111241f2/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":975360808,"appId":"com.coffeehouseapps.slowstoplite","title":"Slow Stop ™ Smoke FREE - Quit Smoking Now App","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slow-stop-smoke-free-quit/id975360808?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Welcome to SLOW STOP™\nThis easy to use app is designed specifically to help smokers take control over their desire to smoke and to slowly but surely, become a non-smoker.\n\n\n\"technical collaboration by Chamin Morikawa (Yubi Interactions)\"","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/d9/e6/8e/d9e68e6d-7672-897b-693c-485c428a2817/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"32276480","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":986254768,"developer":"Dustin Allen","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/dustin-allen/id986254768?uo=4","currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":4,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/2f/ae/31/2fae311b-ba11-0ef7-6723-8631a02c644a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/57/27/e8/5727e837-fbc1-ab4e-ce63-a5cf9be6998f/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/c6/33/71/c63371ab-a449-0212-be71-7e51b9e3c263/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/e8/96/99/e8969946-5593-9be6-4c4f-98b9b9dc419c/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":1114412374,"appId":"com.hypnocloud.stopsmoking","title":"Stop Smoking Hypnosis Free - by Hypno Cloud – “Excellent – It Works!”","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-hypnosis-free/id1114412374?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Stop Smoking Hypnosis FREE - by Hypno Cloud – “Excellent – It Works!”\n\nHave you decided it is time to Stop Smoking?\n\nYou can Become a Nonsmoker with Hypnosis and the soothing, yet powerful voice of a world-class Hypnotist/Hypnotherapist; Victoria Gallagher.

With this app, you will never forget anything again.\n\n• Apple “New Year, New You” Favorite \n• Apple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nLumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life, such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. \n\n“I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza\n\nThe beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! \n\nInstead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. \n\nDesigned exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.\n\nSo what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? \n\nTrack it and get things done!\n\n:: Note to iPhone 6s & 6s Plus users \n\nNow you can ask Siri to find information for you and dictate right into Lumen Trails. For example, hold down the Home button and ask Siri: “How many calories are in a chicken sandwich?”. To start dictation, tap the microphone button on your keyboard and just start talking - your words will be turned into text. \n\n:: Have a Question? \n\nWe are here to help. Email us at support@lumenspark.com, or find us on Twitter @lumentrails.\n\nLumen Trails includes an optional subscription which removes ads and supports ongoing app development.

No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.

It will help you to develop a strong desire to banish junk food, encourage healthy eating habits and to build a strong motivation to exercise regularly. When you enjoy doing these things the struggle to lose weight disappears.\n\nThe second free track, Relax & Sleep Well is a full 29-minute hypnotherapy session that will take you on a relaxing journey into the deepest levels of self-hypnosis. The subtle background soundscapes supporting Glenn’s calming voice will help you to alleviate stress and anxiety, overcome insomnia and encourage healthy sleeping patterns.\n\nLosing weight and becoming fit is all in the mind and Glenn's unique hypnotherapy techniques will help you to programme your mind to become a healthy eater and develop a love for exercising. With the right mental attitude, losing weight is easy and can be achieved without any kind of struggle.\n\nHow the recordings Work:\n\nOn each of Glenn’s hypnosis and meditation recordings you will be safely guided into a very deep state of mental and physical relaxation and then given multiple post-hypnotic suggestions. In the weight loss recording the suggestions are tailored to release any desire for sweet or fattening food, and to eat smaller amounts of healthy food instead. \n\nGlenn's skilled weight control hypnotherapy techniques will also help you to break any past negative associations with eating and dieting, which completely removes any difficulty or struggle from the weight loss process. \n\nThis state of the art recording features:\n\n* A completely free 29-minute weight loss hypnotherapy session. Plus a second free hypnotherapy session for Sleep and Relaxation.\n\n* The very latest hypnotherapy and meditation techniques and state-of-the-art digital recording technology.\n\n* Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnotic vocal techniques guiding you into a completely relaxed state of mind & body.\n\n* Dreamy background sound effects recorded in specific musical keys and frequencies to compliment the hypnotic suggestions and deepen the relaxation effect.\n\n* Stereo-echoed affirmations, which pan from ear-to-ear across the stereo range - a deeply relaxing and unique effect.\n\n\"I did feel pretty rough for a few days (after my hypnotherapy session with Glenn) as my body was missing the sugar, but that soon passed and I feel I'm finally free of my sugar cravings and chocolate addiction! I tried a piece of chocolate to see what happened and it tasted horrible!\"\nAndrea Mclean (TV Presenter)","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/3a/a2/7e/3aa27efc-25b2-91f9-e323-6d8ed5043abb/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"63116288","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2012-08-31T23:54:29Z","updated":"2016-03-16T17:30:01Z","version":"2.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":378088246,"developer":"Diviniti Publishing Ltd","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/diviniti-publishing-ltd/id378088246?uo=4","score":4,"reviews":48,"currentVersionScore":4,"currentVersionReviews":7,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ad/3c/da/ad3cdabf-4016-23cc-aa3a-fbbe8a22f54d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/3a/a7/0f/3aa70fec-f4da-057e-fc42-b3959b833e8a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/19/a8/2f/19a82f10-b281-4106-a446-085307f37195/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/0c/0d/86/0c0d866e-49a0-94ad-8d4e-e914a0f3a103/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/21/04/7e/21047ecd-0b81-987a-cb93-2cb342b31e6b/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/35/73/d4/3573d459-ae2d-5b58-b18e-3ededd5e13d4/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/a2/70/89/a27089e8-0105-c01a-3290-637001372389/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/91/9e/ec/919eecd2-11c2-485a-8b55-ac2b5b2aea3b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/c1/56/c4/c156c4cd-268a-0062-0f37-14e170cb2652/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/cf/ae/3a/cfae3acf-5164-cb96-4657-9c016a5d07ee/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":706296081,"appId":"com.geeo.Kwit2","title":"Kwit 2 - quit smoking - smoking cessation app","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kwit-2-quit-smoking-smoking/id706296081?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Have you recently quit smoking, or been wanting to quit?

She guides you through simple stages of self-hypnosis that will stem the craving and leave you wondering why you ever needed cigarettes.\n\nIt really works! This technique has a remarkable success rate and research figures prove that it is the easiest way to stop smoking.  In 1968 Von Dedenroth reported in the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis a stop smoking success rate of 94% over an 18-month period with no less than a 1,000 smokers. My Stop Smoking In One Hour technique, which has many similarities to Dedenroth’s work and not surprisingly has achieved comparably high success-rate in my private practice in Harley Street. \n\nI am delighted to put my experience in helping thousands of smokers quit, into a practical guide to stopping smoking packed with the most advanced self hypnosis techniques on the market.\n\nThis book is a must-have for anyone who wants to quit.\n‘I smoked 20 a day for four years. Val hypnotized me into stopping with just one session. She’s incredible!’\nNEW YORK POST\n \n‘There is no question. Val’s technique really does work. Try it!’\nSUNDAY MAGAZINE\n \n‘Val is the guru of self-hypnosis’ \nTHE INDEPENDENT\n \n‘If you want to give up smoking, look no further. It works.’\nDANI ZUHR, NEW WOMAN\n \nWhy choose this book\n·      Valerie Austin has over 20 years of experience in stopping people smoking.   \n·      For the past 20 years top hypnotherapists from all over the world have come to learn her One Hour Stop Smoking method\n·      She is considered an expert in the field of hypnosis with a world-wide reputation. Having written five highly successful books published by major publishers which have been translated into many languages including Japanese, Hebrew, Spanish and Bahasa Malaysia.\n·      She was commissioned in the late 90’s by the Dean at the University Kebangsaan, Malaysia to teach her Advanced Hypnotherapy course to a selection or teachers, students and a professor at this leading University of psychology. The Health Minister and leading academics was televised giving his approval for her ‘Stop Smoking Technique’ as he presented her graduates with their diploma for her 7-day advanced hypnotherapy course. \n\n·      She coined the words ‘Stop Smoking in One Hour’ in the late 80’s thought impossible to quit in such a short time but proved extraordinary successful and is now considered the norm.  Many therapists have copied her title and even her success-rates and there have even been other books with the same title but she believes that imitation is the highest form of flattery.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/7c/31/04/7c310461-4cd7-c899-0d70-18ddce742867/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical","Books"],"genreIds":["6020","6018"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12697527","requiredOsVersion":"3.1.2","released":"2009-12-30T22:42:55Z","updated":"2010-04-26T17:38:54Z","version":"1.2","price":3.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":337450688,"developer":"The Mobile Software House","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-mobile-software-house/id337450688?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.mobilesoftwarehouse.com","currentVersionScore":1,"currentVersionReviews":2,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/04/02/42/040242a9-3292-6c3a-fb3e-419e0f937f1c/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/b5/d9/23/b5d92381-3e64-d577-f090-fbeab51f1358/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone","iPod-touch","iPod-touch-with-mic","iPhone-3G","iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":925671396,"appId":"com.silverbackis.smokefreebaby","title":"SmokeFree Baby - Stop Smoking","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smokefree-baby-stop-smoking/id925671396?mt=8&uo=4","description":"• Are you pregnant and looking to stop smoking? •\nSmokeFree Baby provides you with expert advice on stopping smoking in pregnancy.\n\n• Key features •\n• New tips and advice on a daily basis throughout your pregnancy – to support you to stop smoking completely or to cut down first\n• Pre-quit tools – to help you get ready to give up smoking and understand what to expect when you quit during pregnancy\n• Progress bar – to help you keep track of your progress \n• Savings calculator – to help you work out how much money you have saved with each cigarette not smoked\n• And a range of exciting tools and new contents that are released after you select a quit date to help you do as much as you possibly can to stop smoking\n\nSmokeFree Baby has been developed by a research team at University College London who specialize in quitting smoking.

It is interesting how so few regular drinkers make the connection between their alcohol intake and problems in their lives.\n\nEven this cyclical pattern of drinking can be damaging and can be stopped with a new mindset – one that can be achieved through hypnosis. Some people engage in binge drinking deliberately. Many, however, find themselves caught in patterns of thinking and behaviour that they would rather change. Whatever the reasons for your binge drinking it is possible to help you to change by using hypnotherapy and meditation.\nUsing a combination hypnotherapy and meditations we aim to be able to 'reprogramme' the behaviour and make the experience of learning to control the consumption of alcohol a liberating experience.\n\nAffirmations and exercise are made for each other. As you work your body, the affirmations infuse your mind with added impact. After just a few workouts with this recording, you will experience the affirmations as regularly recurring thoughts in your mind. This track is designed specifically for a 15-minutes.\n\nYou want to stop smoking and drinking, but you need the motivation to keep yourself on track. Stop Smoking Now Cardio Affirmation is specifically written to help you begin seeing yourself as a non-smoker and capable of kicking the habit.\n\nThis track is designed to help you focus the power of your mind on overcoming your perception of yourself as someone who smokes and the physical nicotine cravings. The affirmations are backed by pulsing exercise music that motivates you to push through the affirmations and your workout to a smoke-free life and personal fitness.\n\nThe track contains two primary affirmations repeated multiple times in both the first person and second person for maximum effectiveness. The primary affirmations are mixed with the repeating interludes \"Non-smoker\" which repeats 30 times and \"Winning the Battle\" which repeats 15 times throughout the track and .\n\nThe primary affirmations are:\n\n1.Beginning today I am a non-smoker and non-drinkier. Beginning today you are a non-smoker and non-drinker. (Repeats 22 times)\n2.Nicotine and alcohol are strong, but I AM stronger! Day by day, I am winning the battle! Nicotine is strong, but you ARE stronger! Day by day, you are winning the battle!\n\n\n--\nRay Davis, Founder\nThe Affirmation Spot (Website)\n\"Because a better life begins one empowered thought at a time.\"","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/6e/7e/c5/6e7ec5fe-9d3b-8cac-16c7-94dfc56e780c/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"57907200","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-12-12T05:16:42Z","updated":"2016-04-11T14:44:52Z","version":"4.1","price":3.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":325075390,"developer":"i-mobilize, inc.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/i-mobilize-inc./id325075390?uo=4","screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/14/79/fd/1479fd08-6d92-ba29-4a25-928a25e3d172/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b0/fa/81/b0fa813d-bc1d-8d96-03c6-4ed9ebe333cc/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b5/e8/e6/b5e8e6fe-97ca-04c7-0b24-56d0a91f2c1d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/58/fb/2a/58fb2a1f-4565-9459-2338-c2b6b22b58bf/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/35/55/08/35550812-1af5-fe67-0a2a-4d8beeed758b/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/64/ce/f7/64cef798-7de3-0a00-1c98-dfe9681be1fb/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/c6/6c/42/c66c4229-7c8b-47a0-7ef8-0de1fb4bbcaf/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/42/ad/88/42ad88d1-0799-ce6c-7a6d-8ad0022dae9b/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":507900298,"appId":"com.argcondor.StopSmoking","title":"Stop Smoking in Five Days","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-in-five-days/id507900298?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Quit smoking and stay quit with Stop Smoking in Five Days for iOS, probably the most comprehensive Quit Smoking App in the AppStore will support you to give up smoking and become free.

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.\n\nBy using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, \ne.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We \ncan also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["DA","NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PL","PT","RU","ES","SV"],"size":"40623684","requiredOsVersion":"4.3","released":"2010-02-02T22:13:22Z","updated":"2012-08-15T18:56:27Z","version":"2.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":344500276,"developer":"On Beat Limited","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://","score":4,"reviews":53,"currentVersionScore":4.5,"currentVersionReviews":22,"screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":292329425,"appId":"kr.co.iphoneos.QuitSmoke","title":"Quit Smoking Helper","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-helper/id292329425?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Please quit smoking.\nIf you want to quit, may be you need some help.\nThis application is simple, but may be it can help you.\n\nSet the price of your favorite tobacco, and number of i for a day.\nAnd, you check to start. then this app show to you;\n\n- Your period of quit smoking.\n- Your extended life.\n- Your saved money.\n\nQuit Smoking for your life and your family.\nGood Luck!","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/3d/57/ae/3d57aea0-2817-fafc-0f5b-56296bfedfdb/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN","FR","DE","JA","KO","ZH","ES"],"size":"1212416","requiredOsVersion":"7.0","released":"2008-10-03T04:33:22Z","updated":"2014-04-02T20:54:42Z","version":"3.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":292078297,"developer":"Tae-han Kim","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/tae-han-kim/id292078297?uo=4","score":2,"reviews":61,"currentVersionScore":4,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/90/8b/6f/908b6f32-f58d-ec07-6d60-a33b487ac0e6/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/8a/32/7b/8a327b93-4833-7cdd-0799-b32371beca0e/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/aa/e3/11/aae3113a-9447-b4e4-e3f2-00f362e66347/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":592666813,"appId":"com.analognest.quitsmokinghypnosis","title":"Quit Smoking Hypnosis by Mindifi - Stop Addiction Now","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-hypnosis-by-mindifi/id592666813?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Celebrating over 2 Million Mindifi Listeners! \n\nIf you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. \n\nIf you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. \n\nLet's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: \n\n1). \"Quit Smoking- Preparation\" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)\n\nListen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. \n\n2). \"Smoking Cessation\" \n\nYou will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. \n\n3). \"Smoke-Free Sleep Track\" \n\nStart listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit.

Meditation can be the help and support that you need to quit that habit. \n\n\n\nA Yale University research study confirms the benefits of Mindfulness and mediation when it comes to quitting an addiction.  \n\nThe research shows that 30% of people who practice meditation to quit smoking did not smoke a single cigarette in the first week of training, versus the 6% of people who used traditional methods to quit smoking.\n\n\n\nAn addicted brain is a brain with a great load of stress; it´s a brain that works too fast. Meditation gets the brain to relax and reduces the excess of its activity. \n\n\n\nMost smokers know that tobacco is bad for their health; if they don’t quit, it´s because they don´t have the necessary means and tools to say no. \n\n\n\nMeditation and Mindfulness will provide the necessary resources to quit smoking \n\n\n\nAdaptable to new iPhone 5 and iPad Mini \n\n\n\nThis application will help you to: \n\nGain the willpower necessary to avoid tobacco\n\nCalm down before smoking so your anxiety doesn´t control you.\n\nBecome aware of how disgusting tobacco smoke is (something the smoker has forgotten over time)\n\nAvoid automation of smoking; you will quit smoking in “auto pilot”\n\n\n\nScientific studies:\n\n\"Meditate daily for 8 weeks make significant changes in brain regions associated with memory, wellbeing and stress. \" - Sara Lazar, Massachusetts General Hospital (United States) \n\n\"Through meditating, we are able to improve our well-beings and quality of life.\" - Dr. Britta Hölzel \n\n\"If we want to be truly happy, we must learn to exercise our brains regulary\"- Richard Davidson, professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin in Madison","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/a3/a7/0e/a3a70ee2-796d-c621-2733-33b5a42ea994/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","ZH","ES","ZH"],"size":"47058944","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2013-04-12T01:27:22Z","updated":"2013-08-15T22:26:44Z","version":"2.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":480768661,"developer":"Hector Rodriguez Fornies","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hector-rodriguez-fornies/id480768661?uo=4","currentVersionScore":1.5,"currentVersionReviews":2,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/eb/c6/01/ebc60167-33a0-dae0-db5e-5b1d581e97f5/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/df/d8/c3/dfd8c3e6-e777-9828-784d-9c2933713ffb/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/fb/5e/c6/fb5ec62e-b2fe-c640-382a-9956f07b42eb/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fa/90/78/fa907878-0d25-893c-a202-86a90ace5eec/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/41/f0/f3/41f0f397-f8d7-76da-5439-752f6cacd3dc/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/cb/de/7f/cbde7fc9-bdb1-c96f-1f6b-9242491c1082/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/ae/76/d3ae76bb-19f1-7cad-d991-ea205ed8560b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/37/c0/ae/37c0ae24-9d14-d1c0-e6e3-7b6af159f638/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e5/da/ef/e5daefb8-f555-a88f-e7d4-e8e49b572a83/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/fd/ed/d3fdede3-0f44-9774-7f52-452d59703eb4/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":560446511,"appId":"com.snappademics.smokefree","title":"3-2-1 Quit Smoking Now!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/3-2-1-quit-smoking-now!/id560446511?mt=8&uo=4","description":"3-2-1 Quit Smoking Now!

Stop Smoking For Life in just 2 hours! NOW COMPLETELY FREE! NO PURCHASE REQUIRED!\n\nOver 2 MILLION Jason Vale books sold worldwide and creator of the No.1 BEST-SELLING APP '7lbs in 7 Days: super juice diet’ *\n\nSTOP SMOKING IN 2 HOURS requires NO WILLPOWER...NO GUMS OR PATCHES...NO GIMMICKS... Just a Simple Way to Freedom.\n\nAddiction and health author Jason Vale ran a \"Stop Smoking\" clinic for 9 years and successfully helped thousands of people to become smoke-free.  Jason used to smoke 40-60 cigarettes a day himself, until he learnt the secret to stopping in 1995, and hasn’t smoked since! Now, YOU can learn Jason’s secret from his tried and tested programme from the convenience of your own iPhone / iPod / iPad. Jason is literally in your pocket every step of the way!\n\nStop Smoking in Just 2 hours and remain Free for Life!  There are only 2 simple steps:\n\n1) Watch the short opening video\n2) Listen to the two 1 hour audio sessions\n\nThat’s it, you are now FREE - it's that easy!  Extra BONUS material includes:\n\n* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom\n\n* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the \"5 day adjustment period\"\n\n* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for life\n\nJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”\n\nJason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”\n\nAppdiction Review:\n\n\"Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.\"","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"349286400","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2012-01-23T04:33:18Z","updated":"2016-01-08T23:40:59Z","version":"2.1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":493242642,"developer":"Juice Master","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.juicemaster.com/Stop-Smoking-in-2-hours","score":4.5,"reviews":24,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":7,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":458916516,"appId":"com.KeatsPascoe.No-Smoking","title":"The Best No Smoking App","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-best-no-smoking-app/id458916516?mt=8&uo=4","description":"No Smoking is an app made for anyone who is having troubles breaking their habit.  No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.  You will hardly notice you've cut back until you've quit.  There is also a motivation and tip section for when you are feeling weak or you are slipping off your schedule.  The app also keeps track of some very interesting statistics including averages, maximums, minimums, saved money, saved tar and nicotine levels and more.  Even if you aren't ready to quit, get this app and run it for a while, then check the stats and you may just change your mind.\n\n- keep track of money, smokes, nicotine and more\n- quit at your own pace with many options to tailor to your situation\n- manually add or remove smokes for when you forget\n- motivation and tips for when you are feeling weak","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e2/91/23/e291236c-2220-af5d-df62-be5851baef12/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"3641344","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2011-09-13T22:25:56Z","updated":"2014-04-20T02:27:56Z","version":"2.3.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":375591377,"developer":"Snappy Appz Inc.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/snappy-appz-inc./id375591377?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://snappyappz.com","currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/85/3b/98/853b9830-e56f-c312-cff7-ccddf41aa3bd/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/a3/4e/daa34ee5-ab5d-db26-d9e6-ec5daeb1608c/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a1/ae/40/a1ae4065-e404-8bf1-02f7-a2fc6d99d730/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/68/53/3a/68533ad2-819b-a62e-228c-fcdfe82cc7e7/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":968824591,"appId":"com.myh.quitnet","title":"QuitNet: Stop smoking and quit nicotine for life","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quitnet-stop-smoking-quit/id968824591?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Don’t quit alone.

Stop Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nStop Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Stop Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nStop smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Stop Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.  Download the Stop Smoking App & get started with the first session for free!

This uses the latest mind/body technology so you’ll no longer see yourself as a smoker...you’ll see yourself as a non-smoker. Non-smokers don’t buy cigarettes, nor do they\nsmoke.\n\nTo see permanent change on the outside, you must first create the change of belief on the inside. Failing to do so is the reason people stop smoking and go back to smoking in some cases even more! They use willpower to stop themselves from smoking but don’t change the “program” and self-image that makes them want to smoke.\n\nThe main premise of this program is to create the behavior and belief that you DO NOT want to smoke, and reinforce that in your subconscious. You will find this method of changing your belief about cigarettes to be amazingly simple, yet incredibly empowering.\n\nBottom Line...It Works!!!\n\nLite Version includes: 1 Hypnosis Session & 1 Background Music Track.\n\nUPGRADE:\n\nIf you like the sound quality, the ability to create your own custom hypnosis session with multiple sound playback and overall ease of use, you'll love the full version of My Hypnosis Custom Non Smoker.\n\nThe full version of My Hypnosis Custom Non Smoker includes: 5 different hypnosis\ntracks along with 4 choices of background music or no music at all.

After 80 engaging minutes “in the company of” Allen Carr – you will gain the key to set yourself free.\n\nWhatever you do – DO NOT STOP SMOKING before you have viewed this entire app. Given that you’re planning to stop smoking - being told to “carry on” for a little longer is probably a little confusing…but no doubt music to your ears. \n\nAt this point you’re probably finding the concept of it being “easy to stop smoking” a little hard to believe but all we ask is that you progress through this app, carry on smoking, and follow the instructions. When you are ready to have your final cigarette you’ll understand why Allen Carr’s Easyway method has sold more than 14 MILLION books worldwide almost entirely on the strength of word of mouth; it works!\n\nWhether you are a chainsmoker, an occasional smoker, a cigar or pipe smoker, young or old, or whether you’re using e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or any other nicotine product this app can set you free. If you haven’t smoked in the past few days – there is no need to do so – other than that – please do carry on smoking as normal while you make your way through this app.\n\nAN ADDED BONUS\n\nThis app is proudly supported by Allen Carr’s worldwide network of stop smoking clinics. If at any stage during or after the use of this app you have any questions or concerns or require additional guidance you are very welcome to contact your nearest Allen Carr’s Easyway Clinic for free of charge advice. A link to the clinics is included in the app.\nAllen Carr’s Easyway is the most successful stop-smoking method of all time. It has helped millions of smokers from all over the world quit\n\n•instantly \n•easily \n•painlessly\n•permanently\n\nAllen Carr’s Easyway does not require willpower as it removes your desire to smoke. It eliminates the fears that keep you hooked and you won’t miss cigarettes. There are no gimmicks or scare tactics, you won’t put on weight, and you continue to smoke while you watch.\n\nIF YOU FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS IT IS EASY TO BECOME A HAPPY NON-SMOKER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE\n\nSound issues?\n\nWe have investigated this thoroughly and found no technical sound issues with the app. However, some devices use the ‘side switch’ to either lock the screen orientation or to mute sounds. This is customisable in the settings on your device and has been the solution for many of the reported sound issues. Thanks for your continued support and patience!\n\n\n“Allen Carr explodes the myth that giving up smoking is difficult.” – The Times\n\n “A different approach. A stunning success.” – The Sun\n\n “Allow Allen Carr to help you escape painlessly today.” – The Observer\n\n“His method is absolutely unique, removing the dependence on cigarettes.” – Sir Richard Branson\n\n“I was really impressed by the method. In spite of the success and fame of Allen Carr’s Easyway, there were no gimmicks and the professional was something a GP could readily respect. I would be happy to give a medical endorsement of the method to anyone.” – Dr PM Bray MB, CHb, MRCGP\n\n“Instantly I was freed from my addiction. I found it not only easy but unbelievably enjoyable to stay stopped.” – Sir Anthony Hopkins\n\n“Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking program achieved for me a thing that I thought was not possible – to give up a thirty-year smoking habit literally overnight.

How about finally joining the ranks of real NONSMOKERS and really quit without the agony from cravings.  \n\nYou already know that you spend too much on your unhealthy habit.  What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nQuit Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Quit Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nQuit Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nQuit smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Quit Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.  Download the Quit Smoking App & get started with the first session for free! The install is free, with no obligation, nothing to lose, and so much to gain.\nDownload and install Quit Smoking!","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/a0/8b/b8/a08bb8ab-75bf-c1aa-1f0d-c300b04c02a7/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Productivity"],"genreIds":["6013","6007"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"20230144","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2014-05-30T03:53:34Z","updated":"2015-01-06T19:32:15Z","version":"1.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":467457672,"developer":"AB Mobile Apps LLC.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ab-mobile-apps-llc./id467457672?uo=4","screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/79/b0/48/79b04870-b669-4bad-2884-be853d6410d7/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/07/00/22/0700224f-e97a-1aca-8aa6-361bcb3bee1d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/94/18/ad/9418adf2-854b-b73e-281d-992d4266bca4/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/d7/e8/30/d7e830fb-3a3b-b4ba-43db-e497f5ab92e1/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/b3/f2/95/b3f2959f-b014-879a-ef11-38860f0e8f4d/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/de/9b/6a/de9b6a41-1f6d-0c50-7647-903eb2b338b1/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/79/60/69/79606905-7d6b-d9ad-b011-c33e9efd779e/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d5/ca/74/d5ca744a-0ef6-574d-3a8a-71535c643a1a/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/ed/98/0d/ed980d38-4f8e-28a4-522a-15cb94fb1dfd/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":938009829,"appId":"com.vapeboss.vapeboss","title":"Vape Boss","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vape-boss/id938009829?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Vape Boss is the most comprehensive Vape resource ever created!

But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way.\n \nTim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way.\n \nPart One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking.\n \nPart Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why. \n \nPart Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation.\n \nPart Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again.\n \nYour progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing.

He eliminates the fears that keep you hooked and you won’t miss cigarettes. There are no gimmicks or scare tactics, you won’t put on weight, and you can continue to smoke while you watch!\n\nWhatever you do – DO NOT STOP SMOKING before you have viewed this entire app. Given that you’re planning to stop smoking - being told to “carry on” for a little longer is probably a little confusing…but no doubt music to your ears. \n\nAt this point you’re probably finding the concept of it being “easy to stop smoking” a little hard to believe but all we ask is that you progress through this app, carry on smoking, and follow the instructions. When you are ready to have your final cigarette you’ll understand why Allen Carr’s Easyway method has sold more than 15 MILLION books worldwide almost entirely on the strength of word of mouth; it works!\n\nWhether you are a chainsmoker, an occasional smoker, a cigar or pipe smoker, young or old, or whether you’re using e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or any other nicotine product this app can set you free. If you haven’t smoked in the past few days – there is no need to do so – other than that – please do carry on smoking as normal while you make your way through this app.\n\nAN ADDED BONUS\n\nThis app is proudly supported by Allen Carr’s worldwide network of stop smoking clinics. If at any stage during or after the use of this app you have any questions or concerns or require additional guidance you are very welcome to contact your nearest Allen Carr’s Easyway Clinic for free of charge advice. A link to the clinics is included in the app.\n\nAllen Carr’s Easyway is the most successful stop-smoking method of all time. It has helped millions of smokers from all over the world quit\n\n• instantly \n• easily \n• painlessly\n• permanently\n\nIF YOU FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS IT IS EASY TO BECOME A HAPPY NON-SMOKER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE\n\n“Allen Carr explodes the myth that giving up smoking is difficult.” – The Times\n\n“A different approach. A stunning success.” – The Sun\n\n“Allow Allen Carr to help you escape painlessly today.” – The Observer\n\n“His method is absolutely unique, removing the dependence on cigarettes.” – Sir Richard Branson\n\n“I was really impressed by the method. In spite of the success and fame of Allen Carr’s Easyway, there were no gimmicks and the professional was something a GP could readily respect. I would be happy to give a medical endorsement of the method to anyone.” – Dr PM Bray MB, CHb, MRCGP\n\n“Instantly I was freed from my addiction. I found it not only easy but unbelievably enjoyable to stay stopped.” – Sir Anthony Hopkins\n\n“Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking program achieved for me a thing that I thought was not possible – to give up a thirty-year smoking habit literally overnight. It was nothing short of a miracle.” – Anjelica Huston\n\nNote: This application uses GPS to identify your country. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple60/v4/bd/4a/6e/bd4a6ed7-882d-2a3d-2ccf-3ef2149a6ab2/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN","DE"],"size":"20790272","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2015-01-11T19:03:16Z","updated":"2016-05-13T01:14:56Z","version":"3.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":585624867,"developer":"Arcturus Digital LTD","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/arcturus-digital-ltd/id585624867?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.easywaypublishing.com/","screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/95/9a/eb/959aeb0a-29ea-14a9-0420-99a5b93f4935/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e0/84/46/e0844642-292a-af29-3e55-c15f298af455/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/07/15/12/071512d5-b73a-0ba1-26af-5a6ff865ac49/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/16/c6/e9/16c6e9ed-283f-f486-3aa0-c33ef39eba93/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/08/96/14/0896144a-91f6-6dae-c7b6-9231ce11b6cc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/15/50/2f/15502f02-9481-be24-5a9a-2c7731246ae1/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/3b/d0/f6/3bd0f63f-e8a5-03f4-6e96-dc8edcfd9184/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e6/f6/21/e6f621e5-7966-f7e1-7a7d-f8f911277cda/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/f3/0b/a2/f30ba292-b9ce-cddd-755f-0cd71525526d/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/9e/3c/f3/9e3cf3be-ed66-8962-9d3c-86ef8fe8d9a0/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":1096542213,"appId":"com.NoSmokingCalendar.scope","title":"No Smoking Calendar - Stop smoking cigarettes and stop smoking tobacco","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/no-smoking-calendar-stop-smoking/id1096542213?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Tobacco addiction among men is on the rise.

Just take one day at a time and look forward to the new you without Tobacco in your life. Not only will this app help you stop smoking, but it will help you become more social.\n\nTop 10 reasons to quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco:\n\n1. You smell like smoke constantly\n\nNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!\n\n2. You age quicker\n\nYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!\n\n3. Your sense of smell and taste decline\n\nBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. \n\n4. Your social network\n\nBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!\n\n5. Smaller dating pool\n\nAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.\n\n6. Impotence\n\nSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. \n\n7. Chances of infection are increased\n\nFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.\n\n8. Dangers to others\n\nSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?\n\n9. Decreased physical activity\n\nMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved. Smoking causes the lungs and heart to work harder, which decreases cardiovascular abilities. \n\n10. Cost of smoking cigarettes \n\nJust on cigarettes alone, the average smoker can spend $3,000 a year on cigarettes. If that isn’t enough to sway your opinion, think about the well being risks that you will inevitably be paying for down the road.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/4f/24/90/4f249088-aa14-5b22-592d-462930a2f322/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"50624512","requiredOsVersion":"8.1","released":"2016-04-01T03:06:55Z","updated":"2016-04-01T03:06:55Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":953610384,"developer":"App Diggity, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://appdiggity.com","screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/bc/52/9a/bc529a7d-6016-c9c1-c838-7bf2f5f2faed/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/79/a9/b7/79a9b76f-6780-ae0c-9cf7-2e262285c5e8/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2a/d6/8e/2ad68e70-bdb6-8bf6-3b77-b53be2f2540a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/73/79/83/7379836d-c236-740a-e36a-3f87009c6df0/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ef/50/9e/ef509e18-b6e4-752a-fe3f-5e5576ffddc4/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ba/03/e5/ba03e579-69de-97b3-df33-227994c03bd2/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/83/b1/e8/83b1e821-2cc3-7928-c29b-aff65644a046/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2b/10/7f/2b107f26-f410-9a37-deb2-d8307902b491/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b8/3a/5c/b83a5c58-0200-60b1-bc5e-b8ab4123116c/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/fc/69/db/fc69db8f-f5b0-c389-2a85-f89545e1b45f/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":425705079,"appId":"it.albertobonetti.motivator","title":"Motivator - Stop Smoking with your personal motivator!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motivator-stop-smoking-your/id425705079?mt=8&uo=4","description":"How many times have you tried to quit smoking? \n\nIt's the right time to succeed, here is the right app!\n\nStudies show that smokers who have someone to provide support, are more successful in giving up cigarettes than smokers who try to quit on their own.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? \nChoose your personal motivator to support you and stay focused on your goal! \nIt is easier to be successful if you are not alone and someone trusts you and supports you when it would be difficult endure.\n\nTrack your progress on the calendar and take a look to your daily improvement.\nIt will be rewarding to see the little \"super\" star!\nYou can visualize and share with friends the progresses that you are making. \n\nIf your personal motivators and the progress list are not enough for you, take a look at the list of the best reasons to stop smoking: it will help you to stay focused and to achieve your goal.\n\nCome on!

This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.\nHypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.\nHypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.\nAnd the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.\nSo it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.\nIt may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.\nTwo days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.\nLong term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.\nIn the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12333056","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-10-16T12:37:44Z","version":"2.0","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":335619213,"developer":"iCan Hypnosis","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ican-hypnosis.com/","score":3.5,"reviews":35,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":924784747,"appId":"com.healthiertennessee.streaks","title":"Streaks for Small Starts — Create healthy habits","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streaks-for-small-starts-create/id924784747?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Trying to get healthier can feel overwhelming, but Streaks for Small Starts changes that.

Glenn is one of the world's best-selling hypnotherapists with multi-million sales of his Apps, CDs, MP3s and 7 self-help books.\n\nGlenn was a regular 20-a-day smoker until he quit forever in 1987 and he understands the smoking habit from personal experience. He has created these two unique hypnosis recordings to help you to become a non-smoker by reprogramming your unconscious mind. This way, being a non-smoker will feel completely normal and natural to you. \n\nOn both hypnosis audio tracks you will be safely guided into a very deep state of mental and physical relaxation and then given multiple post-hypnotic suggestions that you don't smoke, and that you will remain a non-smoker forever. Glenn's utilises his skilled hypnotherapy techniques to help you break all past associations with smoking, which completely removes the struggle from stopping smoking. You will also be given positive suggestions and affirmations to prevent you from putting on weight or substituting any other negative patterns of behaviour in place of the smoking habit. In fact when you stop smoking your motivation and desire to keep fit and healthy will become stronger than ever. \n\nQuitting Smoking is easy with hypnotherapy, as this method is uniquely effective in programming the mind to overcome the addiction to cigarettes and nicotine. Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques and production will help you achieve this goal in a safe and natural way. \n\nThis App Includes:\n\nHypnosis Audio Tracks\n• Stop Smoking Now 31:31 mins\n• Stop Smoking Forever 28:22 mins\n• 12 Minute Sleep Booster\n\neBooks by Glenn Harrold\n• De-Stress - The 8 Golden Rules\n• The Ultimate Guide To Self Hypnosis\n• How To Use This App\n• About The Author\n\nStop Smoking features two powerful hypnotherapy sessions containing:\n• Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques guiding you into a deep state of mental and physical relaxation.\n• The very latest state-of-the-art recording technology.\n• Background sound effects recorded in specific musical keys and frequencies to compliment the hypnotic suggestions and enhance the deep trance effect.\n• Hypnotic echoed backing vocals panning from left to right across the stereo range - a unique hypnotic effect.\n• Powerful subliminal suggestions embedded under the fade out music to maximise the overall effectiveness of the recordings.\n\nGlenn has over 20 years experience as a full-time hypnotherapist and works with many celebrity clients.

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.\n\nBy using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, \ne.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We \ncan also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["DA","NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PL","PT","RU","ES","SV"],"size":"40623684","requiredOsVersion":"4.3","released":"2010-02-02T22:13:22Z","updated":"2012-08-15T18:56:27Z","version":"2.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":344500276,"developer":"On Beat Limited","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://","score":4,"reviews":53,"currentVersionScore":4.5,"currentVersionReviews":22,"screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":741949277,"appId":"com.surfcityapps.quitsmoking","title":"Quit Smoking Hypnosis - Hypnotherapy to Help Stop Smoking Cigarettes Now","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-smoking-hypnosis-hypnotherapy/id741949277?mt=8&uo=4","description":"◉ Learn to reduce cigarette cravings after listening daily for just 1–3 weeks\n◉ Change your mindset through subconscious thoughts to kick the habit\n◉ You won’t have to try to quit smoking — it just happens naturally!\n\nTRAIN YOUR MIND TO HELP YOU QUIT SMOKING THROUGH HYPNOSIS\n\nDo you want to quit, but just haven’t been able to start?

Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. \n\nIf you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. \n\nLet's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: \n\n1). \"Quit Smoking- Preparation\" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)\n\nListen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. \n\n2). \"Smoking Cessation\" \n\nYou will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. \n\n3). \"Smoke-Free Sleep Track\" \n\nStart listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! \n\n4). \"Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster\" \n\nThis short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes.

Stop Smoking For Life in just 2 hours! NOW COMPLETELY FREE! NO PURCHASE REQUIRED!\n\nOver 2 MILLION Jason Vale books sold worldwide and creator of the No.1 BEST-SELLING APP '7lbs in 7 Days: super juice diet’ *\n\nSTOP SMOKING IN 2 HOURS requires NO WILLPOWER...NO GUMS OR PATCHES...NO GIMMICKS... Just a Simple Way to Freedom.\n\nAddiction and health author Jason Vale ran a \"Stop Smoking\" clinic for 9 years and successfully helped thousands of people to become smoke-free.  Jason used to smoke 40-60 cigarettes a day himself, until he learnt the secret to stopping in 1995, and hasn’t smoked since! Now, YOU can learn Jason’s secret from his tried and tested programme from the convenience of your own iPhone / iPod / iPad. Jason is literally in your pocket every step of the way!\n\nStop Smoking in Just 2 hours and remain Free for Life!  There are only 2 simple steps:\n\n1) Watch the short opening video\n2) Listen to the two 1 hour audio sessions\n\nThat’s it, you are now FREE - it's that easy!  Extra BONUS material includes:\n\n* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom\n\n* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the \"5 day adjustment period\"\n\n* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for life\n\nJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”\n\nJason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”\n\nAppdiction Review:\n\n\"Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.\"","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"349286400","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2012-01-23T04:33:18Z","updated":"2016-01-08T23:40:59Z","version":"2.1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":493242642,"developer":"Juice Master","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.juicemaster.com/Stop-Smoking-in-2-hours","score":4.5,"reviews":24,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":7,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":951148043,"appId":"com.abma.free.stopsmoking","title":"Stop Smoking: A free quit smoking program","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-free-quit-smoking/id951148043?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Stop Smoking today and get started for FREE with the Stop Smoking app\n\nThe Stop Smoking app incorporates proven methods and then super charges them with this mobile app to help you quit smoking now!\n\nThe one of a kind Stop Smoking app uses state of the art technology to help you quit smoking and stay a Nonsmoker.  \n\nWith features such as:\n\n•A step by step quit smoking program\n•A daily quit smoking agenda\n•Personalized notifications that help you succeed\n•One of a kind analysis on your smoking habits and behaviors with recommended course of actions \n•An integrated tracker that helps you know how much money you have saved and spent on cigarettes. \n•A daily activity or action \n•Unique social system to help you quit with a friend\n•A conversation forum to connect with other people who have quit smoking\n•Reasons to quit with helpful reminders\n•Notes section to help track your progress and document you your habits\n•One of a kind quit smoking assignment system\n•Quit Smoking Session System\n\nStart quitting today with the Stop Smoking app, Download for FREE today!\n\nReady to quit AGAIN?

How about finally joining the ranks of real NONSMOKERS and really quit without the agony from cravings.  \n\nYou already know that you spend too much on your unhealthy habit.  What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nStop Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Stop Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nStop Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Stop Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nStop smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Stop Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.

But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way.\n \nTim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way.\n \nPart One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking.\n \nPart Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why. \n \nPart Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation.\n \nPart Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again.\n \nYour progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing. You’ll be amazed by how quickly you start to enjoy the benefits of being a non-smoker.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/77/3f/2f/773f2fcf-8fcb-1ce9-4854-cb1ca783d27a/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"46960640","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2014-11-25T14:11:40Z","updated":"2015-06-30T02:16:24Z","version":"1.2.2","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":930436697,"developer":"The Stop Switch","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-stop-switch/id930436697?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.thestopswitch.com","screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/60/bf/58/60bf58a0-f8db-e981-8afd-ff78deb496d7/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/74/58/c5/7458c53b-844a-6ecc-d865-3b3079c7de1b/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d8/db/8d/d8db8d93-a790-8a86-319a-2bc3e2ccd5b5/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/6c/1f/60/6c1f60c6-0751-3406-4b3a-ea0c8df54df6/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/bf/e8/85/bfe8850a-7d98-27f0-4ba2-75d75d6fa113/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":480714652,"appId":"com.lauruss.nonSmokerLite","title":"My Hypnosis Stop Smoking Lite Version","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-hypnosis-stop-smoking-lite/id480714652?mt=8&uo=4","description":"“My Hypnosis Apps are simply the best customizable hypnosis applications available for your iPhone or iPod Touch.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*****Get this FREE Non Smoking Hypnosis Session for all frustrated smokers out\nthere*****\n\nMy Hypnosis™ Healthy Non Smoker Session will change your views of yourself at the\ncore level.

Non-smokers don’t buy cigarettes, nor do they\nsmoke.\n\nTo see permanent change on the outside, you must first create the change of belief on the inside. Failing to do so is the reason people stop smoking and go back to smoking in some cases even more! They use willpower to stop themselves from smoking but don’t change the “program” and self-image that makes them want to smoke.\n\nThe main premise of this program is to create the behavior and belief that you DO NOT want to smoke, and reinforce that in your subconscious. You will find this method of changing your belief about cigarettes to be amazingly simple, yet incredibly empowering.\n\nBottom Line...It Works!!!\n\nLite Version includes: 1 Hypnosis Session & 1 Background Music Track.\n\nUPGRADE:\n\nIf you like the sound quality, the ability to create your own custom hypnosis session with multiple sound playback and overall ease of use, you'll love the full version of My Hypnosis Custom Non Smoker.\n\nThe full version of My Hypnosis Custom Non Smoker includes: 5 different hypnosis\ntracks along with 4 choices of background music or no music at all.

Are you an expert at quitting because you have quit so many times. How about finally joining the ranks of real NONSMOKERS and really quit without the agony from cravings.  \n\nYou already know that you spend too much on your unhealthy habit.  What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nQuit Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Quit Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nQuit Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nQuit smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Quit Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.

Not only will this app help you stop smoking, but it will help you become more social.\n\nTop 10 reasons to quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco:\n\n1. You smell like smoke constantly\n\nNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!\n\n2. You age quicker\n\nYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!\n\n3. Your sense of smell and taste decline\n\nBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. \n\n4. Your social network\n\nBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!\n\n5. Smaller dating pool\n\nAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.\n\n6. Impotence\n\nSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. \n\n7. Chances of infection are increased\n\nFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.\n\n8. Dangers to others\n\nSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?\n\n9. Decreased physical activity\n\nMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved.

This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.\nHypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.\nHypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.\nAnd the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.\nSo it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.\nIt may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.\nTwo days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.\nLong term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.\nIn the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12333056","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-10-16T12:37:44Z","version":"2.0","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":335619213,"developer":"iCan Hypnosis","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ican-hypnosis.com/","score":3.5,"reviews":35,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":661991795,"appId":"com.t3apps.stopsmokingfree","title":"Stop Smoking.

Save your lungs and mind","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/no-marijuana-calendar-stop/id1104097762?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Marijuana addiction among young adults is on the rise. With Marijuana being so readily available, it is no surprise that not many people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. The No Marijuana Calendar can help you put an end to your Marijuana addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your addiction to Marijuana. \n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your Marijuana addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about Marijuana addiction, and reasons to quit.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nSmoking Marijuana overloads your serotonin receptors and decreases your motivation to meet new people. This can destroy your life if you let it. Don't let Marijuana addiction get the best of you. Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.\n\nTake a look at our top 10 reasons to quit marijuana:\n\n1. You will have a clear mind \n\nFor many lifelong smokers, this is the number one reason to quit smoking. If you are finding yourself forgetting simple things and having your mind in a fog for several hours to days after smoking, then quitting marijuana might be the right thing to do.  \n\n2. Being Ambitious  \n\nMany people with bright futures have reported that marijuana use destroys their ambition. They come up with interesting ideas when they are high, but don't have the motivation to push through when the time comes. They end up being very complacent and don't live up to their full potential. \n\n3. Being Energetic \n\nAs you age, marijuana starts to take a toll on your body in many ways. Smoking pot to overcome mundane tasks is why you may have started in the first place, but after a while, your lungs will start to clog and your blood flow will slow.  \n\n4. Having better eating habits \n\nEveryone knows that smoking marijuana speeds up your metabolism, which in turn makes you very hungry. This is commonly known as the munchies. No matter what type of foods you are eating, you are still putting a damper on your overall health and digestive tract. \n\n5. Having clean lungs \n\nThere has been conflicting research about the negative effects of smoking weed, but the unanimous agreement is that you are still inhaling smoke. Chronic use can lead to emphysema, cancer, and other serious health issues. \n6. Living life by the laws \n\nThe longer you smoke weed, the more chances you have of running into trouble with the law. Sure, the growing trend of legalization makes us more brazen about marijuana smoking, but possession is still illegal in most states and STILL a federal crime no matter what.  \n\n7. Personal safety \n\nIs your drug dealer really your friend? He may appear to be, but somewhere along his supply chain, there is some serious illegal activity going on. People who engage in illegal activity are more likely to commit violent crimes which you don't want to be caught in the middle of. \n\n8. Save your money \n\nI think this goes without saying! Good marijuana is expensive these days, and according to TIME magazine, the average marijuana smoker spends $1800 a year on weed (About $35 a week). That saved money can go to a better cause. \n\n9. Social life \n\nMost marijuana users start out smoking as a social activity, but more often than not, they end up smoking alone without anyone around. We end up avoiding friends, family, and social gatherings because of the paranoia we feel while high.\n\n10. Better self esteem \n\nPsychological research suggests that heavy marijuana use can lead to depression and anxiety. Marijuana users will normally start smoking to alleviate some sort of pain in their life whether it is physical or emotional.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/0b/10/fa/0b10fa17-e0ba-2b55-5c85-20b5291a78ba/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"50759680","requiredOsVersion":"8.1","released":"2016-04-21T16:09:50Z","updated":"2016-04-21T16:09:50Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":953610384,"developer":"App Diggity, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://appdiggity.com","screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/8c/02/c2/8c02c2ca-b307-c62c-ce8a-a1b8557a2abf/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/69/be/38/69be38d9-5a44-cc8d-6e8a-2ed1950206ef/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/24/8e/5d/248e5d53-e52c-5ace-93ba-75de47a479b6/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/eb/d8/8e/ebd88e8d-751d-b59b-5b31-0bf3ae75675d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/f1/45/e1/f145e127-5eac-25de-da49-59aa7df1d6a1/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/56/f4/05/56f40596-17d5-0756-d9a3-27fc935b883d/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/25/a2/17/25a2170b-85b7-036a-43eb-aee7be076a81/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3f/1f/13/3f1f135c-7815-cc8c-f859-bb49c3991ed7/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/b6/b8/bb/b6b8bb49-339f-1f3d-4221-b11baf533c2a/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/cc/b3/94/ccb39497-eee3-6c35-81b9-b1ac111241f2/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":975360808,"appId":"com.coffeehouseapps.slowstoplite","title":"Slow Stop ™ Smoke FREE - Quit Smoking Now App","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slow-stop-smoke-free-quit/id975360808?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Welcome to SLOW STOP™\nThis easy to use app is designed specifically to help smokers take control over their desire to smoke and to slowly but surely, become a non-smoker.\n\n\n\"technical collaboration by Chamin Morikawa (Yubi Interactions)\"","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/d9/e6/8e/d9e68e6d-7672-897b-693c-485c428a2817/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"32276480","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":986254768,"developer":"Dustin Allen","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/dustin-allen/id986254768?uo=4","currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":4,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/2f/ae/31/2fae311b-ba11-0ef7-6723-8631a02c644a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/57/27/e8/5727e837-fbc1-ab4e-ce63-a5cf9be6998f/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/c6/33/71/c63371ab-a449-0212-be71-7e51b9e3c263/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/e8/96/99/e8969946-5593-9be6-4c4f-98b9b9dc419c/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":1114412374,"appId":"com.hypnocloud.stopsmoking","title":"Stop Smoking Hypnosis Free - by Hypno Cloud – “Excellent – It Works!”","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-hypnosis-free/id1114412374?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Stop Smoking Hypnosis FREE - by Hypno Cloud – “Excellent – It Works!”\n\nHave you decided it is time to Stop Smoking?\n\nYou can Become a Nonsmoker with Hypnosis and the soothing, yet powerful voice of a world-class Hypnotist/Hypnotherapist; Victoria Gallagher.

With this app, you will never forget anything again.\n\n• Apple “New Year, New You” Favorite \n• Apple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nLumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life, such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. \n\n“I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza\n\nThe beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! \n\nInstead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. \n\nDesigned exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.\n\nSo what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? \n\nTrack it and get things done!\n\n:: Note to iPhone 6s & 6s Plus users \n\nNow you can ask Siri to find information for you and dictate right into Lumen Trails. For example, hold down the Home button and ask Siri: “How many calories are in a chicken sandwich?”. To start dictation, tap the microphone button on your keyboard and just start talking - your words will be turned into text. \n\n:: Have a Question? \n\nWe are here to help. Email us at support@lumenspark.com, or find us on Twitter @lumentrails.\n\nLumen Trails includes an optional subscription which removes ads and supports ongoing app development.

No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.

It will help you to develop a strong desire to banish junk food, encourage healthy eating habits and to build a strong motivation to exercise regularly. When you enjoy doing these things the struggle to lose weight disappears.\n\nThe second free track, Relax & Sleep Well is a full 29-minute hypnotherapy session that will take you on a relaxing journey into the deepest levels of self-hypnosis. The subtle background soundscapes supporting Glenn’s calming voice will help you to alleviate stress and anxiety, overcome insomnia and encourage healthy sleeping patterns.\n\nLosing weight and becoming fit is all in the mind and Glenn's unique hypnotherapy techniques will help you to programme your mind to become a healthy eater and develop a love for exercising. With the right mental attitude, losing weight is easy and can be achieved without any kind of struggle.\n\nHow the recordings Work:\n\nOn each of Glenn’s hypnosis and meditation recordings you will be safely guided into a very deep state of mental and physical relaxation and then given multiple post-hypnotic suggestions. In the weight loss recording the suggestions are tailored to release any desire for sweet or fattening food, and to eat smaller amounts of healthy food instead. \n\nGlenn's skilled weight control hypnotherapy techniques will also help you to break any past negative associations with eating and dieting, which completely removes any difficulty or struggle from the weight loss process. \n\nThis state of the art recording features:\n\n* A completely free 29-minute weight loss hypnotherapy session. Plus a second free hypnotherapy session for Sleep and Relaxation.\n\n* The very latest hypnotherapy and meditation techniques and state-of-the-art digital recording technology.\n\n* Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnotic vocal techniques guiding you into a completely relaxed state of mind & body.\n\n* Dreamy background sound effects recorded in specific musical keys and frequencies to compliment the hypnotic suggestions and deepen the relaxation effect.\n\n* Stereo-echoed affirmations, which pan from ear-to-ear across the stereo range - a deeply relaxing and unique effect.\n\n\"I did feel pretty rough for a few days (after my hypnotherapy session with Glenn) as my body was missing the sugar, but that soon passed and I feel I'm finally free of my sugar cravings and chocolate addiction! I tried a piece of chocolate to see what happened and it tasted horrible!\"\nAndrea Mclean (TV Presenter)","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/3a/a2/7e/3aa27efc-25b2-91f9-e323-6d8ed5043abb/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"63116288","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2012-08-31T23:54:29Z","updated":"2016-03-16T17:30:01Z","version":"2.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":378088246,"developer":"Diviniti Publishing Ltd","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/diviniti-publishing-ltd/id378088246?uo=4","score":4,"reviews":48,"currentVersionScore":4,"currentVersionReviews":7,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ad/3c/da/ad3cdabf-4016-23cc-aa3a-fbbe8a22f54d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/3a/a7/0f/3aa70fec-f4da-057e-fc42-b3959b833e8a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/19/a8/2f/19a82f10-b281-4106-a446-085307f37195/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/0c/0d/86/0c0d866e-49a0-94ad-8d4e-e914a0f3a103/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/21/04/7e/21047ecd-0b81-987a-cb93-2cb342b31e6b/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/35/73/d4/3573d459-ae2d-5b58-b18e-3ededd5e13d4/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/a2/70/89/a27089e8-0105-c01a-3290-637001372389/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/91/9e/ec/919eecd2-11c2-485a-8b55-ac2b5b2aea3b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/c1/56/c4/c156c4cd-268a-0062-0f37-14e170cb2652/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/cf/ae/3a/cfae3acf-5164-cb96-4657-9c016a5d07ee/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":706296081,"appId":"com.geeo.Kwit2","title":"Kwit 2 - quit smoking - smoking cessation app","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kwit-2-quit-smoking-smoking/id706296081?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Have you recently quit smoking, or been wanting to quit?

She guides you through simple stages of self-hypnosis that will stem the craving and leave you wondering why you ever needed cigarettes.\n\nIt really works! This technique has a remarkable success rate and research figures prove that it is the easiest way to stop smoking.  In 1968 Von Dedenroth reported in the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis a stop smoking success rate of 94% over an 18-month period with no less than a 1,000 smokers. My Stop Smoking In One Hour technique, which has many similarities to Dedenroth’s work and not surprisingly has achieved comparably high success-rate in my private practice in Harley Street. \n\nI am delighted to put my experience in helping thousands of smokers quit, into a practical guide to stopping smoking packed with the most advanced self hypnosis techniques on the market.\n\nThis book is a must-have for anyone who wants to quit.\n‘I smoked 20 a day for four years. Val hypnotized me into stopping with just one session. She’s incredible!’\nNEW YORK POST\n \n‘There is no question. Val’s technique really does work. Try it!’\nSUNDAY MAGAZINE\n \n‘Val is the guru of self-hypnosis’ \nTHE INDEPENDENT\n \n‘If you want to give up smoking, look no further. It works.’\nDANI ZUHR, NEW WOMAN\n \nWhy choose this book\n·      Valerie Austin has over 20 years of experience in stopping people smoking.   \n·      For the past 20 years top hypnotherapists from all over the world have come to learn her One Hour Stop Smoking method\n·      She is considered an expert in the field of hypnosis with a world-wide reputation. Having written five highly successful books published by major publishers which have been translated into many languages including Japanese, Hebrew, Spanish and Bahasa Malaysia.\n·      She was commissioned in the late 90’s by the Dean at the University Kebangsaan, Malaysia to teach her Advanced Hypnotherapy course to a selection or teachers, students and a professor at this leading University of psychology. The Health Minister and leading academics was televised giving his approval for her ‘Stop Smoking Technique’ as he presented her graduates with their diploma for her 7-day advanced hypnotherapy course. \n\n·      She coined the words ‘Stop Smoking in One Hour’ in the late 80’s thought impossible to quit in such a short time but proved extraordinary successful and is now considered the norm.  Many therapists have copied her title and even her success-rates and there have even been other books with the same title but she believes that imitation is the highest form of flattery.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/7c/31/04/7c310461-4cd7-c899-0d70-18ddce742867/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical","Books"],"genreIds":["6020","6018"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12697527","requiredOsVersion":"3.1.2","released":"2009-12-30T22:42:55Z","updated":"2010-04-26T17:38:54Z","version":"1.2","price":3.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":337450688,"developer":"The Mobile Software House","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-mobile-software-house/id337450688?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.mobilesoftwarehouse.com","currentVersionScore":1,"currentVersionReviews":2,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/04/02/42/040242a9-3292-6c3a-fb3e-419e0f937f1c/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/b5/d9/23/b5d92381-3e64-d577-f090-fbeab51f1358/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone","iPod-touch","iPod-touch-with-mic","iPhone-3G","iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":925671396,"appId":"com.silverbackis.smokefreebaby","title":"SmokeFree Baby - Stop Smoking","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smokefree-baby-stop-smoking/id925671396?mt=8&uo=4","description":"• Are you pregnant and looking to stop smoking? •\nSmokeFree Baby provides you with expert advice on stopping smoking in pregnancy.\n\n• Key features •\n• New tips and advice on a daily basis throughout your pregnancy – to support you to stop smoking completely or to cut down first\n• Pre-quit tools – to help you get ready to give up smoking and understand what to expect when you quit during pregnancy\n• Progress bar – to help you keep track of your progress \n• Savings calculator – to help you work out how much money you have saved with each cigarette not smoked\n• And a range of exciting tools and new contents that are released after you select a quit date to help you do as much as you possibly can to stop smoking\n\nSmokeFree Baby has been developed by a research team at University College London who specialize in quitting smoking.

It is interesting how so few regular drinkers make the connection between their alcohol intake and problems in their lives.\n\nEven this cyclical pattern of drinking can be damaging and can be stopped with a new mindset – one that can be achieved through hypnosis. Some people engage in binge drinking deliberately. Many, however, find themselves caught in patterns of thinking and behaviour that they would rather change. Whatever the reasons for your binge drinking it is possible to help you to change by using hypnotherapy and meditation.\nUsing a combination hypnotherapy and meditations we aim to be able to 'reprogramme' the behaviour and make the experience of learning to control the consumption of alcohol a liberating experience.\n\nAffirmations and exercise are made for each other. As you work your body, the affirmations infuse your mind with added impact. After just a few workouts with this recording, you will experience the affirmations as regularly recurring thoughts in your mind. This track is designed specifically for a 15-minutes.\n\nYou want to stop smoking and drinking, but you need the motivation to keep yourself on track. Stop Smoking Now Cardio Affirmation is specifically written to help you begin seeing yourself as a non-smoker and capable of kicking the habit.\n\nThis track is designed to help you focus the power of your mind on overcoming your perception of yourself as someone who smokes and the physical nicotine cravings. The affirmations are backed by pulsing exercise music that motivates you to push through the affirmations and your workout to a smoke-free life and personal fitness.\n\nThe track contains two primary affirmations repeated multiple times in both the first person and second person for maximum effectiveness. The primary affirmations are mixed with the repeating interludes \"Non-smoker\" which repeats 30 times and \"Winning the Battle\" which repeats 15 times throughout the track and .\n\nThe primary affirmations are:\n\n1.Beginning today I am a non-smoker and non-drinkier. Beginning today you are a non-smoker and non-drinker. (Repeats 22 times)\n2.Nicotine and alcohol are strong, but I AM stronger! Day by day, I am winning the battle! Nicotine is strong, but you ARE stronger! Day by day, you are winning the battle!\n\n\n--\nRay Davis, Founder\nThe Affirmation Spot (Website)\n\"Because a better life begins one empowered thought at a time.\"","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/6e/7e/c5/6e7ec5fe-9d3b-8cac-16c7-94dfc56e780c/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"57907200","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-12-12T05:16:42Z","updated":"2016-04-11T14:44:52Z","version":"4.1","price":3.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":325075390,"developer":"i-mobilize, inc.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/i-mobilize-inc./id325075390?uo=4","screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/14/79/fd/1479fd08-6d92-ba29-4a25-928a25e3d172/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b0/fa/81/b0fa813d-bc1d-8d96-03c6-4ed9ebe333cc/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b5/e8/e6/b5e8e6fe-97ca-04c7-0b24-56d0a91f2c1d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/58/fb/2a/58fb2a1f-4565-9459-2338-c2b6b22b58bf/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/35/55/08/35550812-1af5-fe67-0a2a-4d8beeed758b/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/64/ce/f7/64cef798-7de3-0a00-1c98-dfe9681be1fb/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/c6/6c/42/c66c4229-7c8b-47a0-7ef8-0de1fb4bbcaf/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/42/ad/88/42ad88d1-0799-ce6c-7a6d-8ad0022dae9b/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":507900298,"appId":"com.argcondor.StopSmoking","title":"Stop Smoking in Five Days","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-smoking-in-five-days/id507900298?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Quit smoking and stay quit with Stop Smoking in Five Days for iOS, probably the most comprehensive Quit Smoking App in the AppStore will support you to give up smoking and become free.

Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment.

I have not had a cigarette in 90 days and actually have no desire at all to light up. I think this program is a great tool to help you quit.\"\n\n\"It won't do all the hard work for you but it can give you a big helping hand when the craving starts. Just look at the graphs and imagine having to go back to square one. Havn't smoked a cigarette since 19th April 2002 after being a smoker for twenty years.\"\n\n\"It really helped me personally to graphicaly see what was happening inside my body and all the other information has only helped strengthened my resolve. I haven't picked up a cigarette since I got it.\"\n\n\"Didnt knew if it was the knowledge of my cc being billed for the app or what but i have no smoked since i bought it it helps a lot to see graphically how your health is. COOL!\"\n\n\"40 years a Smoker until I found My Last Cigarette\nI've tried various methods to stop smoking over the last 40 years. Started when I was 11 years old now 52. I now feel I can say I?m a non-smoker. It's all down to \"My Last Cigarette\" Every morning I turn on my PDA to have a look how many cigarettes I've not smoked. That sets me up for another day without one. If this government is serious about reducing the number of smokers it should by this software and give free on the National Health. In my Lifetime I've smoked 433590 cigarettes but more importantly I've not smoke 4043 since I stopped on July 27th this year.

How about finally joining the ranks of real NONSMOKERS and really quit without the agony from cravings.  \n\nYou already know that you spend too much on your unhealthy habit.  What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nStop Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Stop Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nStop Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Stop Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nStop smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Stop Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.

How about finally joining the ranks of real NONSMOKERS and really quit without the agony from cravings.  \n\nYou already know that you spend too much on your unhealthy habit.  What you need to know is how you can finally quit for good.\n\nQuit Smoking uses tested, evidence based and scientifically proven techniques and strategies recommended and approved by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Universities and governmental agencies. Quit Smoking is then technologically super charged into an app to give you a one of a kind, individualized program, to help you quit smoking on you own, without public meetings or counseling and adapted to your lifestyle.\n\nQuit Smoking enables you to stop smoking after a six week program in which you continue to smoke, BUT learn how to “not smoke”.  You will also be simultaneously weaned free from the addiction of nicotine. This app is not simply a cigarette counter like all the rest.  This app is a real program to free you from smoking forever!\n\n1.    Using our unique tracker, you will log every cigarette that you smoke, what you were doing and when you smoked.  Smokers just smoke and are not aware why.  Learn why you smoke with analyses of triggers and habits, delinking your behaviors that chain you to smoking.\n\n2.    In a step by step process, we will also gradually reduce your intake of nicotine and tar.  We are going to put more and more limits on when, where, what and how you can smoke, delinking your triggers and reducing your nicotine absorption. At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.\n\n3.    Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSuccessful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  \n\nThe app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!\n\nQuit smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers. \n\nStart saving money by using the Quit Smoking app to give up smoking for good. \n\nEnjoy the app with a friend or family member.

This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.\nHypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.\nHypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.\nAnd the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.\nSo it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.\nIt may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.\nTwo days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.\nLong term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.\nIn the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"12333056","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","updated":"2015-10-16T12:37:44Z","version":"2.0","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":335619213,"developer":"iCan Hypnosis","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ican-hypnosis.com/","score":3.5,"reviews":35,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":564151376,"appId":"com.icanbeanything.beClean","title":"I Can Be Clean","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/i-can-be-clean/id564151376?mt=8&uo=4","description":"★ Happy! - I feel cleaner & happy to clean without getting distracted\nby Indtchi - feb 28, 2013\n\n★ Awesome - Love this app, it’s really made a difference.

Tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive, making the process of quitting often very prolonged and difficult.\n\nSmoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide, and quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk of dying from tobacco-related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer. Seventy percent of smokers would like to quit smoking, and 50 percent report attempting to quit within the past year. Many different strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including quitting without assistance (\"cold turkey\" or cut down then quit), medications such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline, and behavioral counseling. The majority of smokers who try to quit do so without assistance, though only 3 to 6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful. Use of medications and behavioral counseling both increase success rates, and a combination of both medication and behavioral interventions has been shown to be even more effective.\n\nBecause nicotine is addictive, quitting smoking leads to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as craving, anxiety and irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally endeavor to address both nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal symptoms.\n\nWith this app you can learn on the Go, Anytime & Everywhere.

I have used them in other areas of my life that required intelligent, rational, and responsible choosing.” – Dana\n\nWhen I refer patients and friends to your program, they usually ask me if I really believe that it works. With complete conviction I tell them, “If you want to quit, and you use what Clean Break teaches, you will quit and you will start feeling good about it immediately!” – Thomas, M.D \n\n“The power of nicotine addiction is such that even though I was desperate in the extreme to quit, I was unable to even try. I had failed so many times and in so many ways and was afraid that nothing would work for me.

If you really want to stop, this will make it easy and safe. \n\nMany smokers who try to stop using other methods, report that they suffer misery and depression caused by the feeling that they are being deprived of a pleasure or a crutch. The beauty of our technique is that it removes the feeling of deprivation. It removes the need and the desire to smoke. It is based on NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming) and incorporates the power of hypnosis.\n\nEvery smoker knows that smoking is bad of them, and they do it anyway because of an unconscious belief that it somehow provides a benefit.

When someone offers you a cigarette, or anything else to smoke it will be as if you have never tried smoking before, and thus you will have no interest.The cutting edge techniques in this app like Hypnosis and NLP will help you learn to change the way you perceive smoking and end your addiction forever. \n\nDOWNLOAD Stop Smoking Hypnosis NOW and Start Living Your New Life Today!","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/38/d3/69/38d3694b-d1c1-8086-cc81-de665535444c/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6020","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"36528128","requiredOsVersion":"5.0","released":"2012-10-28T15:20:58Z","updated":"2014-08-28T21:55:51Z","version":"2.1","price":99.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":546384368,"developer":"Turnt Apps LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/turnt-apps-llc/id546384368?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://betteryouapps.com","screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/57/1f/df/571fdf7b-c14f-11d7-053c-9f088f3f488c/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/df/52/f7/df52f799-fec4-302a-3e16-523d770000e9/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/71/ee/1f/71ee1f4f-87ed-ff94-d69f-dbe22c1953ff/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/0b/60/f5/0b60f560-4f11-e824-baf0-60649b4c04bf/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/d2/1b/9e/d21b9e03-fdf2-2005-fa19-8d513aa618d3/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/86/2e/8f/862e8f15-9375-95e8-7e7b-6e4e6cbea89d/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a2/1a/4a/a21a4a37-0ea2-4a02-67d2-f75ea915a69e/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d4/0a/aa/d40aaa88-8eeb-5635-49db-c41ca902bb5e/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/23/d4/0f/23d40f71-b3e1-d39b-78e0-b37e7289fa51/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/73/6d/49/736d497d-255c-73fb-f78a-105f49ffe35c/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":592696605,"appId":"com.TA.CTCNew","title":"Crush The Crave","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crush-the-crave/id592696605?mt=8&uo=4","description":"The average young adult takes as many as 30 days to quit smoking, and the hardest part is doing it alone.

But why do so many people fail? \n\nThe reason is, as so often, in ourselves. We consciously know that smoking is injurious to health. But smoking is a subconscious reaction to different triggers and a habit that we have developed over a long time.  According to medical studies the actual nicotine dependence is over after just one week of non smoking. But the habit stays and thoughts revolve around smoking permanently. This vicious circle can be broken with the powerful technique of hypnosis..!\n\nThe suggestions in this program will help you change the way you think about smoking. Get the necessary motivation for building a new healthy life-style without cigarettes and nicotine. Listening to \"Get smoke-free! \" will make you feel healthier, happier, more alive and free of this addiction at last.\n\n\nABOUT KIM FLECKENSTEIN\n\n„Get smoke-free!“ was designed by well-known German Hypnotherapist Kim Fleckenstein.

(It is not a simple smoking management App.)\n\nNeverSmoking enables you to quit smoking permanently by removing the fundamental smoking-neuron which is an emotional information attracting thoughts of cigarette. \n\nNeverSmoking enables a powerful quitting smoking effect through activation of the mirror neurons through the innate facial recognition system of the brain, emotional priming through facial feedback and thoracic respiration. It is a safe yet a powerful therapy to quit smoking.\n\nNeverSmoking removes the false reward system created by nicotine in the smoker’s brain and replaces it with a new synaptic connection\n\nNeverSmoking enables the smoker to gain an accurate understanding of one’s addiction so that they can intelligently and systematically manage the smoking desires in order to make thoughts of tobacco to never recur and quit smoking permanently in a short period of time(usually within a month).\n\nNeverSmoking is composed of 200 expressions and 21 topics and it runs based on automatic analysis of the smoker’s dispositions, patterns and terms of smoking and their sensorial characteristics.\n\nIt is designed so that the user can quit smoking by merely mimicking the contents on the screen.\n\nNeverSmoking app is based on years of data and expert know-hows on smoking cessation.\n\nWith NeverSmoking, you will be able to quit smoking for good in the most healthy and fundamental way and you will never crave smoking.\n\n\n* How to Use the Program\n1.

This app combines ancient Chinese healing techniques used in acupuncture and qi gong to quit smoking naturally, without patches, vaporizers, gums, or any other chemical substances.  Install this app to access:\n\n- detox stretch / qi gong video\n- hypnosis audio to break addictions\n- step-by-step guide to reduce cravings \n- positive reinforcement techniques to quit smoking\n- psychological techniques to automate new habits \n- calculate money saved and health benefits for your lifespan\n- support your goals by dedicating your progress to friends, family, and loved ones\n- track progress, view history, capture repeated triggers and trends\n- count total days logged on and celebrate your successes\n\nDetox Stretch / Qi Gong Video\nHaving physical support is critical, especially for the first month as you quit smoking.  If the chemicals in cigarettes have side effects on the body, why would we use chemical solutions like nicotine gum, patches, and electronic cigarettes to quit?  Will power cannot stop your body from going into withdrawal.  Will power cannot force the body into clearing toxins.  Physical addiction to smoking happens because the body becomes dependent on the chemicals absorbed when smoking.  When those chemical levels drop, your body goes into withdrawal and wants to smoke again to alleviate the pain.  Doing detox stretches will support the body, soothe discomfort, and help transition through the withdrawal period.  A gentle healing method based on Chinese medicine, Qi Gong works with the energy in the body to naturally cleanse and restore balance.  Awaken the body's natural intelligence, stimulate your internal systems, and direct vital healing energy to areas in need of revitalising.   \n\nHypnosis Audio to Break Addictions\nAddiction is a pattern of behavior that has become so ingrained in the subconscious that we become attached to it even if the conscious mind tries to stop.  If the conscious mind could stop with a simple decision, then it wouldn't be an addiction.  The difference between an addiction and other desires is control.  The subconscious mind controls the automatic functions of the body.  You don't have to remind yourself to breathe in and out to stay alive, the subconscious mind is handling that for you.  When the subconscious mind attaches meaning to a pattern of behaviour, it doesn't matter if the conscious mind tells it to stop because the conscious mind is no longer in control.  You need to access the subconscious mind to make a lasting change.  Using will power alone to quit smoking can feel useless, disappointing, and stressful.  Hypnosis allows you to work with the subconscious mind, so you can connect to the source of the addiction and stop smoking easefully and naturally.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Reduce Cravings\nRe-train your brain to make healthy choices by using positive reinforcement and proven psychological techniques to automate new habits.  It only takes 21 days to create a new pattern of behaviour.  Follow the program for 21 days in a row and quit smoking for good!\n\nSet Goals and Monitor Progress\nView your history to see how far you've come, calculate the money you saved, see your health benefits, and celebrate your successes!\n\nDedicate Your Progress to Friends, Family, and Loved Ones (optional)\nSimply click the Edit Button to upload a picture of someone close to you and enter their name to remind yourself of why you are willing to get healthy and stay healthy.  This information is completely confidential, so you don`t have to feel any pressure during the process.

It has a simple user interface and uses a complex algorithm for precise calculations.\n\nWatch your BAC rise and fall on the graph and analyze your consumption. Set a limit and get notified when you exceed or fall below your limit.\n \nThe LITE version has advertising and limits you to adding no more than 3 drinks per day. PRO features include Multi-User Support, Custom Drink Templates and User Statistics. PRO features can be accessed via In-App Purchases or the PRO version.\n \nDr. Gary Rosen, Professor of Mathematics, University of Southern California (USC):\n\"We used IntelliDrink to obtain estimated BAC in a research project aiming to calibrate sophisticated data analysis software for autonomous transdermal alcohol sensors. It has been ideal for our purposes, and we are planning on using it in a number of future studies.\"\n\n\nUser comments:\n \n\"As an expert in the field of BAC absorption and elimination, I am impressed by this app.\"\n \n\"Incredible. Absolutely wonderful and fascinating algorithm that takes into account absorption time.\"\n \n\"By far the best drink tracking app I've found... Cheers!\"\n \n\"Way better (and easier to use) than expected. I can really, truly see this being a life-saver (or DUI).\"\n \n\"Great app. I have been using it for a few weeks and tonight used it side by side with an Alco-sensor device that was just calibrated. It was within .001! I was surprised. This thing is accurate. Good job.\"\n \n\"This app is simply amazing. None of the other bac/drink tracking apps out there even come close!\"\n \n\"A great deal. Seems very accurate. It really helps you get an idea of how long after a drink it affects you. The app looks great. The multi users is easy to switch between, letting you easily track friends. They seem to have the formula that is most accurate. Takes into account the time it takes you to have a drink. Real time graph is informative. 10 star A+++ app\"\n \n \nHere are some features of IntelliDrink:\n \n- It uses a sophisticated algorithm for precise calculations based on scientific knowledge.\n \n- It calculates the absorption and metabolism of alcohol over time.\n \n- You can analyze your alcohol consumption using the statistics it provides.\n\n- Apple HealthKit integration. Can read age, weight, height, sex and write BAC and calories.\n\n- You own your data! IntelliDrink does not send any private data to the cloud.\n \n- It features a BAC alarm that notifies you when you exceed or fall below your limit.\n \n- It considers your age, weight, height, gender, drinking frequency and stomach content.\n \n- You can create new drinks or modify existing ones.\n\n- It’s battery friendly, with no background calculations.\n \n \nA lot of effort was put into IntelliDrink’s algorithm for calculating the values. Most BAC calculators assume that you quickly downed your drink, and, even worse, they assume that you’ve already completely digested the drink. This is not how it works in real life.\n\nThe core concept of IntelliDrink is based on the scientifically accepted Widmark formula, which is used by the German justice system. This formula allows you to your BAC based on how many grams of alcohol you ingested.\nBut this formula does not consider the amount of time it takes you to ingest a drink, the content level of your stomach, or the speed of your metabolism.\n\nIntelliDrink takes all of these factors into consideration because it uses a much more precise algorithm. When you use IntelliDrink, you can access data supported by solid scientific research in a beautiful and easy-to-use interface.\n\nPlease note that the values should be used only as a guide and should never be used to determine if you are able to drive.\nIntelliDrink accepts no responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided.","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple20/v4/8b/de/7b/8bde7b82-fc77-b493-d893-1a73e263a304/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Food & Drink","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6023","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Food & Drink","primaryGenreId":6023,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN","DE"],"size":"39436288","requiredOsVersion":"9.0","released":"2015-08-18T01:33:23Z","updated":"2016-08-10T05:36:36Z","version":"2.2","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":376866758,"developer":"Raphael Wichmann","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/raphael-wichmann/id376866758?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.intellidrink.com","score":4.5,"reviews":24,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":6,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple20/v4/b0/6c/3a/b06c3a08-f7d2-07d5-5e0d-352b441fcc20/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/89/6b/91/896b9171-5abb-50df-ba12-6693241e0e94/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/f3/93/aa/f393aa42-ac8d-f77f-6189-d4533da34da1/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple20/v4/ba/7c/d2/ba7cd2e2-308c-5679-1ecb-1315c7e5704c/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/d8/7a/a0/d87aa0aa-4447-296f-be2e-2d5d38e937a6/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":366653950,"appId":"com.healthstatus.healthcalcs","title":"HealthCalcs – Blood Alcohol, Body Mass Index, Body Fat Percentage, Calorie Burn, Calories to Lose, and Ideal Weight calculator","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/healthcalcs-blood-alcohol/id366653950?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Do you want to know how much extra exercise you need to do to burn off that piece of cake you just ate?  \nDo you want an estimate of your body fat or need your current BMI?  \nDo you want to know your healthiest weight? \nDo you want to know how many calories you burn each day?  \nEver wondered what your blood alcohol level (BAC) is?  \n\nWith the HealthCalcs application from HEALTHSTATUS.COM you can have all this information right at your fingertips.  \n\nComes with these easy to use calculators based on scientific algorithms:\n* blood alcohol calculator\n* body fat estimation (2 formulas)\n* body mass index\n* calories burned (with over 125 activities)\n* ideal weight calculator\n* lose how much\n\nMetric AND U.S. measures supported!\n\nComplete a few entries and whole wealth of health information will be right at your fingertips, and you can post your results directly to Facebook or Twitter from inside the application.  \n\nThe calories burned and lose how much calculators show you data on over 130 different activities.

It has a simple user interface and uses a complex algorithm for precise calculations.\n\nWatch your BAC rise and fall on the graph and analyze your consumption. Set a limit and get notified when you exceed or fall below your limit.\n \nDr. Gary Rosen, Professor of Mathematics, University of Southern California (USC):\n\"We used IntelliDrink to obtain estimated BAC in a research project aiming to calibrate sophisticated data analysis software for autonomous transdermal alcohol sensors. It has been ideal for our purposes, and we are planning on using it in a number of future studies.\"\n\n\nUser comments:\n \n\"As an expert in the field of BAC absorption and elimination, I am impressed by this app.\"\n \n\"Incredible. Absolutely wonderful and fascinating algorithm that takes into account absorption time.\"\n \n\"By far the best drink tracking app I've found... Cheers!\"\n \n\"Way better (and easier to use) than expected. I can really, truly see this being a life-saver (or DUI).\"\n \n\"Great app. I have been using it for a few weeks and tonight used it side by side with an Alco-sensor device that was just calibrated. It was within .001! I was surprised. This thing is accurate. Good job.\"\n \n\"This app is simply amazing. None of the other bac/drink tracking apps out there even come close!\"\n \n\"A great deal. Seems very accurate. It really helps you get an idea of how long after a drink it affects you. The app looks great. The multi users is easy to switch between, letting you easily track friends. They seem to have the formula that is most accurate. Takes into account the time it takes you to have a drink. Real time graph is informative. 10 star A+++ app\"\n \n \nHere are some features of IntelliDrink:\n \n- It uses a sophisticated algorithm for precise calculations based on scientific knowledge.\n \n- It calculates the absorption and metabolism of alcohol over time.\n \n- You can analyze your alcohol consumption using the statistics it provides.\n\n- Apple HealthKit integration. Can read age, weight, height, sex and write BAC and calories.\n\n- You own your data! IntelliDrink does not send any private data to the cloud.\n \n- It features a BAC alarm that notifies you when you exceed or fall below your limit.\n \n- It considers your age, weight, height, gender, drinking frequency and stomach content.\n \n- You can create new drinks or modify existing ones.\n\n- It’s battery friendly, with no background calculations.\n \n \nA lot of effort was put into IntelliDrink’s algorithm for calculating the values. Most BAC calculators assume that you quickly downed your drink, and, even worse, they assume that you’ve already completely digested the drink. This is not how it works in real life.\n\nThe core concept of IntelliDrink is based on the scientifically accepted Widmark formula, which is used by the German justice system. This formula allows you to your BAC based on how many grams of alcohol you ingested.\nBut this formula does not consider the amount of time it takes you to ingest a drink, the content level of your stomach, or the speed of your metabolism.\n\nIntelliDrink takes all of these factors into consideration because it uses a much more precise algorithm. When you use IntelliDrink, you can access data supported by solid scientific research in a beautiful and easy-to-use interface.\n\nPlease note that the values should be used only as a guide and should never be used to determine if you are able to drive.\nIntelliDrink accepts no responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided.","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple30/v4/d4/93/06/d4930681-d13b-00ee-abd6-0250b62756f7/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Food & Drink","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6023","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Food & Drink","primaryGenreId":6023,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN","DE"],"size":"34197504","requiredOsVersion":"9.0","released":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","updated":"2016-08-04T19:53:14Z","version":"2.2","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":376866758,"developer":"Raphael Wichmann","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/raphael-wichmann/id376866758?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.intellidrink.com","score":4.5,"reviews":538,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":22,"screenshots":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/3e/c2/63/3ec263d8-6d22-6246-c75a-3c9660b96406/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/dc/b0/93/dcb093c3-f993-507f-ec8a-86ad3028c173/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/d9/49/44/d94944f9-9114-9dea-b475-9ab9ff65f9f7/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple60/v4/fc/d4/0d/fcd40da9-88ac-011d-1fe2-b0ddd04badb5/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple30/v4/14/70/dc/1470dcc9-d237-a46b-3b21-0482777b1d45/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":490079741,"appId":"com.dhollis.101drinking","title":"100+ Drinking Games: College Dorm Frat Drink Party Beer Games","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/100+-drinking-games-college/id490079741?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Drinking is addictive.\nBut playing Drinking Games by App Holdings takes you far beyond than getting addicted to drinking!\n\nYou’ll find yourself glued to your phone all day long playing different games on this app every hour.

With Alcohol being so readily available, it is no surprise that not many men realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. The No Alcohol Calendar can help you put an end to your Alcohol addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your addiction to Alcohol. \n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your Alcohol addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about Alcohol addiction, and reasons to quit.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5.

This can destroy your life if you let it. Don't let Alcohol addiction get the best of you. Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.\n\nTop 10 reasons to quit drinking alcohol:\n\n1. Your immune system will thank you\n\nWithout the negative impacts of alcohol, your immune system will grow stronger. Liquor and other alcohol can wear away linings in the mouth and throat too, making pathogens able to take over more easily. First, it produces an overall nutritional deficiency, depriving the body of valuable immune-boosting nutrients. Second, alcohol, like sugar, consumed in excess can reduce the ability of white cells to kill germs. High doses of alcohol suppress the ability of the white blood cells to multiply, inhibit the action of killer white cells on cancer cells, and lessen the ability of macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factors.\n\n2. No more hangovers\n\nAs you age, your body starts to become less efficient at breaking down hangover causing toxins. For those who have experienced a terrible hangover, we don't really need to say anymore here. It is simply not worth it. \n\n3. You will save plenty of money\n\nAccording to EventBrite, the average partier spends $81 (USD) on a night out drinking and on average, they go out twice a week. Doing some simple math here, that means that you will be saving almost $8500 a year if you cut out the drinking. Invest the money or buy yourself something cool!\n\n4. Your problems actually make sense\n\nWhen you're drunk, little problems become big problems for no reason. When you're sober, you actually have to face reality and you wont be worried about petty things anymore. \n\n5. You will actually remember things\n\nHave you ever gone out for a night of drinking and didn't remember the night? Or maybe even didn't remember bits and pieces? Well that will not happen anymore if you stop drinking. \n\n6. No more losing friends over drunken mistakes\n\nA lot of bad decisions go out the window when you stop getting drunk, and as a result of making fewer poor decisions, your friends will like you more.\n\n7. It's interesting to go out sober\n\nIf you usually went out to get all boozed up with friends, it can be hard to turn back the habit. But you'll realize with time that you don't need booze to have fun. It is a hard habit to kick, but you will become more comfortable with yourself as you progress. \n\n8. You learn why you like your friends\n\nYou'll find that some friends were just friends you went out and drank with. Those friends won't likely hang around. You will find out who your real friends are and get to know yourself better. \n\n9. You find out you can have fun alone\n\nAlcohol can be a real toxic habit, and without it you'll find more about yourself than you knew before. You might just find that you can have fun all by yourself.\n\n10. You look better\n\nAlcohol damages the liver which makes you look a little rougher around the edges. In the end, you'll look younger longer.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/c7/6e/c3/c76ec332-e213-436d-7430-47e97202673e/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"50669568","requiredOsVersion":"8.1","released":"2016-04-01T16:21:28Z","updated":"2016-04-01T16:21:28Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":953610384,"developer":"App Diggity, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://appdiggity.com","currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/df/06/74/df0674e6-83af-20d9-9229-4cec6a1a440c/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b4/06/ca/b406caa7-decc-3c65-602d-2e07dca3ea50/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/16/07/bd/1607bd20-481d-7b54-55e7-eacf464602b2/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ed/d8/f8/edd8f801-12c4-70ee-91a7-e6de75b2d643/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/94/c0/c7/94c0c716-5870-08c3-eb9e-71ee3c86e1ca/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e2/df/d2/e2dfd2b6-6645-0e86-a6d5-88907a24adb7/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/cd/37/71/cd377185-9c54-a155-d547-ded4fb57563a/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ef/70/c1/ef70c1fe-4018-776f-7f1e-2d96c88186d4/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/fe/b0/36/feb0363c-f36a-bbb9-85cb-f2fdecb76558/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/a3/0c/0d/a30c0dbf-3173-4ba8-72fb-12109385ff40/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":438438520,"appId":"cz.simopt.iphone.bacalcoholcalculator","title":"BAC Alcohol Calculator","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bac-alcohol-calculator/id438438520?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Interactive BAC calculator.

Did you know that even one or two drinks can impair your ability to drive? Always plan for a safe ride home BEFORE you start drinking. \n\nR-U- Buzzed estimates your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level based on the interaction of weight, gender, time you’ve been drinking and alcohol consumed. For this calculator, one drink is considered to be equal to 12 oz. of beer, 5 oz. of wine or 1.5 oz. of hard liquor. \n\nUse the “Need a Ride?” button to connect to popular ride-hailing services, including Uber, Lyft, zTrip and Curb.\n\n******************\n\nDisclaimer: This blood alcohol concentration (BAC) calculator is only an estimate and is not sufficiently accurate to be considered legal evidence. The calculations are averages, and many variables could affect an individual’s BAC level.\n\nFood in the stomach, medications, health and psychological conditions are influencing factors and many establishments serve alcohol in portions larger than the standard drink size. Do not use the R-U- Buzzed app to determine whether you should operate a motor vehicle or other heavy equipment. It is never safe to drive after any amount of alcohol. You can be arrested for impaired driving if your driving ability is affected to even the slightest degree.\n\nR-U- Buzzed is provided by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/72/50/e5/7250e59a-d269-bc00-862e-36a0efb25dca/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"10529792","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2009-11-14T18:58:37Z","updated":"2016-09-02T17:22:15Z","version":"2.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":302021434,"developer":"ID345, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/id345-llc/id302021434?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://planaheadcolorado.com","score":3,"reviews":5447,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple20/v4/f8/d6/ba/f8d6ba25-37d5-5a28-588e-a4b83685e43e/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple18/v4/8d/9d/51/8d9d513b-b2b7-bb45-f9a5-85b66df0a0b0/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple30/v4/3b/b0/cc/3bb0cc9e-d746-54e5-33d9-7a87c821e6b2/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple20/v4/87/be/57/87be57dd-ea66-d176-eb25-4c389f26c47a/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":486811622,"appId":"com.distinction.cocktailflow","title":"Cocktail Flow","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cocktail-flow/id486811622?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Create the Moment • Enjoy the Flow\n\nLoved by millions of users worldwide, Cocktail Flow is the ultimate tool to find & create the perfect drink for any occasion.

Perfect your time or challenge your friends in multiplayer mode.\n\n*****************************************************\nAd supported version of Perfect Pour with two beers included.\n\nWith the paid version you get four beers to pour (each one pours differently), a random beer option, new bluetooth head to head racing between two devices and no ads!\n\nThe full version also supports German, Spanish, and Chinese languages.\n\nEnjoy!\n*****************************************************\n\n\nA beer pouring game for your enjoyment. The object is simple - pour the beer into the glass by tilting your iPhone like it's a bottle of beer.  Do it as fast as you can without spilling it.  The trick is to manage how fast you pour vs. how much foam you create.  You have two beers with unique pour characteristics.  We've actually measured real beers to simulate how quickly each one can be poured and how much foam they create.  Really.\n\nHone your pouring skills in a single player game against the clock.  Your best times are stored on a leaderboard.   When you’re ready, challenge your friends to a multiplayer match to see who’s the best.  Up to ten people can play on one device.  With multiplayer, the game is played in timed rounds.  Beat the clock to make a successful pour, but go too fast and it will spill.  Not good.  Try it as a drinking game at your next party, or just challenge your friends for fun.  For an added challenge try the Random beer at the selection screen.  You won't know which beer you'll be pouring until you start to pour.\n\nAwards are handed out at the end for the quickest pour, the most good pours “The Pourmaster”, and for being sloppy.  Yes, spill it the most and you will receive the dreaded “Sloppy Slopperson” award.  Try to live that one down.\n\nFeatures:\nSingle player or multiplayer.\nTwo beers to pour.\nFastest pour time leaderboard for each beer.","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e7/39/e3/e739e3f2-f15e-2c21-8434-b7948202417a/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Entertainment","Games"],"genreIds":["6016","6014"],"primaryGenre":"Entertainment","primaryGenreId":6016,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"3120189","requiredOsVersion":"4.3","released":"2009-10-08T17:57:21Z","updated":"2013-05-16T05:30:09Z","version":"2.1.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":320457614,"developer":"Generally Bored Software","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/generally-bored-software/id320457614?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.generallyboredsoftware.com/Generally_Bored_Software,_LLC/Perfect_Pour.html","score":2.5,"reviews":3018,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d6/0a/fa/d60afae2-0f76-c856-29eb-78052b174755/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c0/0d/92/c00d92bf-dcc8-dc68-8ca1-316b413d6ed4/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ef/50/07/ef50072a-e6f4-9646-0e30-2aefca1cb663/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c2/8c/f2/c28cf2b9-3b01-b83d-22db-7a303fd96b67/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c7/5e/e8/c75ee852-232d-9e19-14aa-7d6d987fb46e/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":894617990,"appId":"hu.laszloagardi.alcoholgame","title":"Alcohol Game - The Party Drinking App","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alcohol-game-party-drinking/id894617990?mt=8&uo=4","description":"The ultimate Alcohol Game is the perfect way to start a party.\nJust spin the wheel and have fun with your friends.\n\nHave a great time :)\n\n-----\nDisclaimer: drink responsibly.

And if you drink irresponsibly - so do the rules around DUI. \n\nSome states are MUCH stricter than others. Don't be caught off guard trying to buy a beer on Sunday in Utah, vodka in a grocery store in Florida, or wine at a convenience store in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, in Texas - you can't take your kids into a liquor store, but you can buy them a six-pack... \n\nState Lines: Alcohol clears up the confusion, providing a clear and concise quick reference to laws around alcohol (and DUI) in all 50 states. \n\nState Lines: Alcohol is location aware, so it can automatically show you information about nearby states. Sometimes crossing a border can drop the taxes on your beer run dramatically - it pays to know. \n\nThe entire State Lines: Alcohol database is integrated into the application, so State Lines: Alcohol works even when you are out of cellular or WiFi coverage. \n\nIf you like State Lines: Alcohol, please check out our more comprehensive and up to date application - State Lines. Currently State Lines tracks 43 pieces of travel relevant information for each of the 50 states; state sales tax, time zones, towing &amp; RV specific laws, gas/diesel taxes, rest area overnight parking rules, default speed limits, alcohol sales laws, smoking bans, open container laws, state park camping entrance fees, pet leash laws, bicycle and motorcycle helmet laws, cell phone &amp; texting bans, left hand turn rules, and more. State Lines is an essential application for anyone traveling around the United States - whether by RV, car, train, bike, plane, or boat. \n\nNo matter how you travel, if you’re frequently crossing state lines, you need State Lines. \n\nState Lines and State Lines: Alcohol are growing projects, and we welcome feedback on ideas for other useful state specific information to include in future versions. \n\nPlease let us know what else you would like us to track! \n\n****** NOTE: State Lines: Alcohol is intended to provide an at-a-glance summarized guide to rules and regulations, and it is not an exhaustive legal reference.

The alcoholic beverages include: beer, wine, whisky, vodka, brandy, martini, tequila or liqueur.

In all cases, it is safest to never drive after drinking. By using this application you assume all risk and responsibility.\n\n_________________________\n\nWhen at a bar, a party, or even at home, you can use Can I Drive Yet to input some simple facts about yourself and what you’ve had to drink. Then, using information available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it will calculate your blood alcohol content (BAC) to help you decide, more accurately, if it is safe to drive. \n\nCan I Drive Yet is designed to help prevent people from making a mistake they will always regret, to help them make the most of their night while staying safe, and to be as simple as possible.\n\nAll this, plus free updates for life and constant usability improvements explain why Can I Drive Yet made the Utilities Top 10 list.\n\n_________________________\n\nSMARTER\nNot only is it smart to use Can I Drive Yet, it remembers when you started drinking, what you've had to drink, and some basic stats about you. The app doesn't need to be running at all times, and, while you wait for the bartender to bring a drink, you can enter it quickly and easily.\n\nSIMPLER\nIn order to give you accurate information, Can I Drive Yet needs to know several details about you and your drinks. However, we've done our best to make it as smooth as silk to enter this data. For example, you only need to enter your weight, gender, and other simple information the first time you setup a profile.\n\nSAFER and HELPFUL\nThough there is no sure-fire way to tell if you're below the legal limit, it is arguably better to calculate your BAC than to ask a friend to watch how much you stumble.\n\n_________________________\n\nMaking the user interface simple and easy to use, even when intoxicated, has always been our goal. Have a look at our feature list below.\n\nFEATURES\n• Allows for user profiles, each with their own name, weight, metabolism, and legal limit settings.\n• Remembers drinks for all profiles* between launches, so getting a phone call or browsing the web won't interfere with your drink list.\n• Supports Notification Center, and will notify you when one of the users in your profile list has possibly reached their legal limit or sobriety!\n• Offers several BAC legal limits. The most common ones from around the world are included - just choose which one is right for you!\n• Prominently displays the time that you started drinking, and makes it easy to change it.\n• Having another beer? It's easy to increase the quantity of a drink in your drink list - just hit the \"+\" button.\n• Offers details about your current BAC, like how long you'll need to wait before you can drive.\n• Takes your metabolism into account - whether you're a lightweight or a heavy drinker, your BAC estimate will be more accurate.\n• Choosing the type of drink will automatically pre-fill other information, such as the serving size and alcohol content, with the most likely values. This makes editing drinks, or adding new ones, as smooth as it gets.\n• Essentially an infinite number of ways to configure a drink: Can I Drive Yet has numerous serving sizes and alcohol percentages from 1 to 99. If a drink you had isn't preconfigured, just customize it!\n\n* Lite version limited to 1 profile and 4 drinks.","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/f6/f0/a4/f6f0a445-fbb2-7563-0dd9-944a90ae8a85/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Food & Drink","Utilities"],"genreIds":["6023","6002"],"primaryGenre":"Food & Drink","primaryGenreId":6023,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"886502","requiredOsVersion":"4.0","released":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","updated":"2012-07-24T21:10:18Z","version":"3.0.3","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":330219687,"developer":"Everything Code, Inc.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/everything-code-inc./id330219687?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://iphone.everythingcode.com/canidriveyet","score":3,"reviews":39,"currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":4,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/14/b1/e7/14b1e755-cb05-fda1-6215-c0ca5ab5e496/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2f/5e/50/2f5e5067-a944-4319-ffa0-db3cbcfdf4bd/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/13/90/e6/1390e628-3570-f60b-dbf2-485aae45da91/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/90/7a/ac/907aac52-0045-01c8-08c9-876a9ad46359/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/91/c6/ca/91c6ca26-d436-576e-9bda-c9fb765d34f3/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPod-touch-with-mic","iPhone-3G","iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":990308161,"appId":"com.goodbarber.bigbookfree","title":"AA Big Book Free — for Alcoholics Anonymous","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aa-big-book-free-for-alcoholics/id990308161?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Take the Big Book wherever you go!\n\nWhether you're new to AA, or you're a seasoned veteran, this is the easiest and most useful app to aid in your recovery.

Is your drinking out of control? Have other people expressed concern that you may be struggling with alcohol addiction?\n\nAre you ready to step away from your old drinking habits and begin your journey toward a new life?\n\nYou have just discovered the key to your journey of recovery: a revolutionary new mobile intervention system that will help you Step Away - and change your drinking habits privately and effectively.\n\nStarting right now.\n\nWith Step Away, you have instant access to useful tools, proven strategies and helpful feedback on your progress toward alcohol addiction recovery - all available with a touch on your personal iPhone. \n\nThe features and information provided within Step Away stem from decades of research on effective interventions for alcohol addiction treatment.  \n\nDuring a pilot study (funded by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism), an early version of Step Away was shown to substantially reduce both overall and problem drinking. People who used the early prototype - which provided far fewer features and less interactivity than this version - for only six weeks, were shown to cut down the days they spent engaged in heavy drinking by 60% and to reduce their overall number of drinks consumed by 50%. \n\nStep Away offers alcohol addiction help when friends, family, therapists or groups may not be available or immediately present. Step Away provides strategies and reminders to help you overcome alcohol addiction during high risk times.\n\nStep Away will be your personal assistant as you go through the process of changing your drinking. It provides the structure you need to help you stop altogether or to reduce your drinking to safe levels. The app empowers you by providing custom configuration for many features so you can decide how it will be most helpful to you. No need to wait until your next meeting with your counselor to receive helpful strategies and feedback on your progress in your journey to conquer alcohol addiction.

A 7 minute video with captivating 3D animations, voiceover & graphics, takes you on a guided tour of the anatomical structures of the brain, to educate about what happens to specific structures in the brain when alcohol is consumed in excess. This information will equip the viewer to make informed choices in relation to alcohol consumption. The anatomical brain structures include the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, medulla, frontal lobes, hypothalamus, & nerve cells. We take a look inside the developing brain, to examine the effects alcohol has on these structures as they grow & develop, & how the physiological effects of alcohol can produce behavioural changes.\n\nWe also examine BAC, or Blood Alcohol Concentration, & how you can estimate what your BAC might be when consuming alcohol. After viewing the video, to assist your understanding of this topic, you can complete a Quiz consisting of 20 multiple choice questions. The Quiz includes an optional \"Hint\" button which enables you to review the portion of the video related to the question. However if a \"Hint\" is used to answer the question, the maximum score out of 1 for a correct answer will be .5.  You also have the option to Tweet your results to others.\n\nThis video was originally produced for a target audience of 18-25 year olds, however it contains valuable educational information for all ages. This App can be used by parents & teachers to educate a younger audience on the dangers of excess alcohol consumption. It can also be used by undergraduate medical, physiotherapy, health science, nursing, pharmacology & exercise science students to understand this topic. Additionally, health professionals can \"Airplay\" this App to youth health education groups, following up with a group discussion on the Quiz section.\n\n2013 Winner - Gold Communicator Award\n2012 Winner - Queensland iAward (Innovation)\n2011 The Global Awards - Finalist \n\nBackground to this production:\n\n3Dme & the Australian Lions Drug Awareness Foundation (ALDAF) share a common vision to improve the targetting, quality, accuracy & reach of drug awareness educational initiatives.

Your immune system will thank you\n\nWithout the negative impacts of alcohol, your immune system will grow stronger. Liquor and other alcohol can wear away linings in the mouth and throat too, making pathogens able to take over more easily. First, it produces an overall nutritional deficiency, depriving the body of valuable immune-boosting nutrients. Second, alcohol, like sugar, consumed in excess can reduce the ability of white cells to kill germs. High doses of alcohol suppress the ability of the white blood cells to multiply, inhibit the action of killer white cells on cancer cells, and lessen the ability of macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factors.\n\n2. No more hangovers\n\nAs you age, your body starts to become less efficient at breaking down hangover causing toxins. For those who have experienced a terrible hangover, we don't really need to say anymore here. It is simply not worth it. \n\n3. You will save plenty of money\n\nAccording to EventBrite, the average partier spends $81 (USD) on a night out drinking and on average, they go out twice a week. Doing some simple math here, that means that you will be saving almost $8500 a year if you cut out the drinking. Invest the money or buy yourself something cool!\n\n4. Your problems actually make sense\n\nWhen you're drunk, little problems become big problems for no reason. When you're sober, you actually have to face reality and you wont be worried about petty things anymore. \n\n5. You will actually remember things\n\nHave you ever gone out for a night of drinking and didn't remember the night? Or maybe even didn't remember bits and pieces? Well that will not happen anymore if you stop drinking. \n\n6. No more losing friends over drunken mistakes\n\nA lot of bad decisions go out the window when you stop getting drunk, and as a result of making fewer poor decisions, your friends will like you more.\n\n7. It's interesting to go out sober\n\nIf you usually went out to get all boozed up with friends, it can be hard to turn back the habit. But you'll realize with time that you don't need booze to have fun. It is a hard habit to kick, but you will become more comfortable with yourself as you progress. \n\n8. You learn why you like your friends\n\nYou'll find that some friends were just friends you went out and drank with. Those friends won't likely hang around. You will find out who your real friends are and get to know yourself better. \n\n9. You find out you can have fun alone\n\nAlcohol can be a real toxic habit, and without it you'll find more about yourself than you knew before. You might just find that you can have fun all by yourself.\n\n10. You look better\n\nAlcohol damages the liver which makes you look a little rougher around the edges. In the end, you'll look younger longer.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/c7/6e/c3/c76ec332-e213-436d-7430-47e97202673e/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"50669568","requiredOsVersion":"8.1","released":"2016-04-01T16:21:28Z","updated":"2016-04-01T16:21:28Z","version":"1.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":953610384,"developer":"App Diggity, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://appdiggity.com","currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/df/06/74/df0674e6-83af-20d9-9229-4cec6a1a440c/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b4/06/ca/b406caa7-decc-3c65-602d-2e07dca3ea50/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/16/07/bd/1607bd20-481d-7b54-55e7-eacf464602b2/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ed/d8/f8/edd8f801-12c4-70ee-91a7-e6de75b2d643/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/94/c0/c7/94c0c716-5870-08c3-eb9e-71ee3c86e1ca/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e2/df/d2/e2dfd2b6-6645-0e86-a6d5-88907a24adb7/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/cd/37/71/cd377185-9c54-a155-d547-ded4fb57563a/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ef/70/c1/ef70c1fe-4018-776f-7f1e-2d96c88186d4/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/fe/b0/36/feb0363c-f36a-bbb9-85cb-f2fdecb76558/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/a3/0c/0d/a30c0dbf-3173-4ba8-72fb-12109385ff40/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":581766693,"appId":"com.jimylive.alcoholaddiction","title":"Quit Drinking Hypnosis - Alcohol Addiction Detox and Recovery for Sober Living","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quit-drinking-hypnosis-alcohol/id581766693?mt=8&uo=4","description":"The #1 App for Overcoming Alcohol Addiction in the App Store\n__________\n\nQuit Drinking Hypnosis will help you...\n\n*  END YOUR ADDICTION TO ALCOHOL NOW\n\n*  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR ALCOHOL INTAKE\n\n*  BECOME HEALTHIER & HAPPIER\n\n*  START YOUR NEW LIFE TODAY\n\nand much MUCH more!\n__________\n\n \"I went from craving and drinking alcohol every night, to now only drinking when I want.

Alcoholism occurs when a person becomes completely dependent on ‘the drink’ to get them through daily life, even at the cost of any problems that may arise, and is sometimes indicative of a physical addiction as well. \nThere are many reasons why people drink. Social situations and psychological factors are the most common. However, those with a family history of excessive drinking are also at a high risk for becoming alcoholics themselves, due to a genetic predisposition to the disease.\nAn addiction to alcohol can take its toll on a person’s life, causing problems at work or with friends and family. It is a debilitating disorder that can lead to various health conditions, such as:\n\n• sleep deprivation\n• blackouts and/or confusion\n• mood swings (varying from depression to violent outbursts)\n• anemia\n• seizures\n• liver and other organ damage\n\nEven if an individual suffering from alcoholism genuinely wants to stop drinking, quitting can be very difficult. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to severe (requiring medical help) and are sometimes a reason many continue drinking. For those who do go into a detoxification program, it is often recommended to treat the anxiety associated with withdrawal symptoms.\nThis is a condition that responds well to self-hypnosis, a safe, drugless therapy that has been shown to have remarkable effectiveness, even when other treatments may fail. It is a particularly successful method when the source of a problem is emotional or tension-related, however deep-rooted it may be. Self-suggestion is a process which strikes at the core of a problem, rather than simply masking the symptoms, making it especially helpful for a variety of complaints.\nThe very term “Hypnosis” is a direct reference to the ancient Greek “Hypnos”, meaning sleep, and indicates the relaxed, sleep-like, state that is necessary for suggestion to take effect. However, many often have trouble reaching this deeper level of consciousness on their own and require the assistance of a skilled hypnotherapist to ease them into, and out of, a hypnotic state. \nMr. Mackinnon is such an individual, having helped countless people over the years to achieve their goals through guided self-hypnosis. The advancements of the Internet have allowed him to make his technique available to more people than ever before. His new iPhone app is designed to work with you, at your own pace, directing your transition from start to finish and ensuring maximum results.","icon":"http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple32/v4/88/71/0d/88710d9a-f033-0c2f-f4a3-caa80b1b679f/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"11837440","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2009-12-18T03:43:06Z","updated":"2015-10-16T12:41:01Z","version":"2.0","price":2.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":335619213,"developer":"iCan Hypnosis","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.ican-hypnosis.com/","score":3,"reviews":18,"currentVersionScore":1,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple32/v4/a4/02/ca/a402ca5f-dd69-9f13-cea2-255017d443d5/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/80/29/14/802914f7-336b-9b63-2f22-d7e97627ebe3/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/bb/ab/5b/bbab5b3b-fcfd-7a6b-9b79-aa9ce77679d9/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple32/v4/b8/6d/68/b86d689a-add7-5c3c-269f-d0c51734c245/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":472922484,"appId":"com.appstore.OvercomeSleep","title":"Sleep, Soothing Relaxation - Hypnosis and Meditation by Rachael Meddows","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-soothing-relaxation/id472922484?mt=8&uo=4","description":"*Featuring the new UNLOCK ALL function!

Since it is legal, and our culture finds no problems with it, coffee flies under the radar as a normal way of life, but it can cause severe problems in your life, just like any other addiction. \n\nCoffee Addiction Calendar addresses the need to quit coffee, and helps you become accountable for making the changes happen!\n\nFeatures:\n1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your coffee addiction.\n2. 10 Science based facts about coffee addiction, and reasons to stop drinking coffee.\n3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. \n5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge to drink coffee by showing you pictures of puppies.\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. \n\nHere are our top 10 reasons to quit drinking coffee:\n\n1. The caffeine in coffee increases your stress hormone production\n\nCatecholamines (or stress hormones) are increased with coffee consumption. This also increases your insulin production which causes inflammation which in turn ends up making you feel sluggish.\n\n2. Coffee decreases insulin sensitivity\n\nWhen you are less sensitive to insulin, your cells are tricked into not responding appropriately to blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can lead to deterioration of your arteries and eventual increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n3. Increase of the release of diterpenes into your system\n\nDiterpenes have been linked to increased levels of LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides. Coffee addiction will perpetuate these issues and you will constantly have to monitor your levels.\n\n4. Drinking coffee increases your anxiety\n\nCoffee stimulates your adrenal glands, which activates your “fight or flight” response. This increases your anxiety and you may feel as if you are in a constant state of panic or nervousness.\n\n5. Did we mention the financial benefits of quitting coffee? \n\nCoffee is expensive! If you are brewing your own coffee, you still have to purchase the equipment to brew it. If you are going to Starbucks every day, you are spending money on that. Average coffee addicts report an average savings of $2000 a year after quitting coffee.\n\n6. Stop the jitters\t\n\nEveryone who has drunk coffee before knows what the jitters are. The sudden burst of energy that comes from drinking coffee is usually not channeled properly for maximum production, and you end up just shaking because of the excess energy.\n\n7. Addiction and reliance to coffee\n\nWe are here because we know that coffee addiction is a thing. Any addiction can have serious repercussions if not properly checked. If you find yourself needing coffee at all times, this is an addiction that you need to break if you want to have a stable life.\n\n8. Sleep like a baby\n\nHave you ever been up at night after a day of drinking coffee and wondered why you cannot sleep? Chances are it is the coffee. From everything mentioned previously, you can understand why this is the case. From adrenal production to jitters, these are some things that you do not want in your life.\n\n9. More stable mood\n\nThe life of a coffee addict is up and down like a roller coaster. You are down when you don’t have it, and up when you do have it. Quitting coffee will make you mind more stable and keep you on a level playing field.\n\n10. Healthier teeth\n\nNo more stains on your teeth! Really, there are not many long term benefits to drinking coffee, so take the step now and really work on breaking the addiction.\n\nIf you are struggling with a coffee addiction, simply download No Coffee Calendar now and break free of your reliance to coffee.

You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n* EFFECTIVE - When in the state of hypnosis, the critical factor of the conscious mind is pushed to the side so the subconscious mind becomes more accessible and open to suggestions. The subconscious mind can also be referred to as your right brain where lays our dreams, intuition, imagination, long term memory, our belief system and our emotions.\n\n* PROVEN - Hypnosis has been an accepted therapeutic intervention by the American Medical Association since 1952 and the American Psychological Association. Added to that, the National Institute of Health has recommended hypnotherapy as a treatment for pain since 1995.\n\n* VALUE - Set yourself free from feelings like fear, frustration, anger, resentment and guilt. Release the blocks that have been holding you back. Break free from negative patterns and negative habits. Let go of painful thoughts and feelings. Transform yourself! Feel lighter and more at peace!\n\n* SAFE - Hypnosis is 100% natural and safe — you are always aware of what is going on. You remain in complete control during the entire session and will not do anything you do not think is acceptable.\n\n--------\n\nBut, will it work for me? Yes! Hypnosis works no matter what your belief system is. It doesn’t matter if you believe in it or not. Hypnosis works because we all have a subconscious mind.\n\nGive it a try and transform your life today!\n\n--------------------\n\nWe offer auto-renewing subscriptions as well a one-time unlock fee via in-app purchase.

They don’t work because people jump into them without the right preparation. \n\nAs I learned from my own experience, you can’t be successful in the action stage if you haven’t been successful in the preparation stage.\n\nAnd did you know that for every person who quits smoking by following a treatment program, there are almost twenty persons who quit on their own?\n\nMany people spend years telling themselves that they’re going to change “one day.” They spend years worrying about the problem instead of working on it. \n\nMaybe they’re waiting for the “perfect” weight-loss program, the “perfect” smoking-cessation program, or the “perfect” time to stop drinking. “I’ll change when the time is right.” \n\nHow many times have you heard that one?\n\nIn this special book, you’ll learn how to turn your life around!\n\nHere is what you will learn inside this book....\n\n# The six stages in the process of breaking bad habits\n\n# How to replace bad habits with a healthy new lifestyle\n\n# How millions of people have succeeded in breaking a bad habit\n\n# Why you have a better chance of freeing yourself from a bad habit by taking responsibility for your own program\n\n# Why successful preparation for change means that you set goals for yourself\n\n# Why change is not an event, but a process\n\n# Why most successful self-changers fail at least once before they succeed\n\n# Why willpower alone isn’t enough\n\n# Why quitting a habit cold turkey usually doesn’t work\n\n# Why a commitment to a more active lifestyle is one of the keys to breaking a bad habit\n\n# And a lot more!\n\nWhen you win the battle in your mind, it’s only a matter of time before you win the war against bad habits. The secret is to make change your No. 1 priority.\n\nYou can’t win the war until freeing yourself from the habit becomes your highest priority.\n\nThe solution is to accept responsibility for yourself, to realize that you can decide to take charge of your life.\n\nThe key to freeing yourself from bad habits is to change your lifestyle. A total lifestyle change isn’t something that happens overnight.\n\nIt happens one day at a time, and it starts when you begin to focus on the solution instead of the problem. Don’t be surprised if you’re not completely sure that you’re ready to break your habit. It’s not about quitting cold turkey. \n\nForcing yourself to quit before you’re mentally and emotionally prepared usually backfires.\n\nFree yourself from bad habits forever by start reading this book!\n\n*** On Sale Now!

Pacifica gives you holistic tools to address it based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness, relaxation, and health.\n\nStress, anxiety, and depression are caused by an ongoing cycle of thoughts. Thoughts cause physical feelings which cause actions. Pacifica attempts to break this cycle using tools that target each of its components. Day-by-day, you'll learn to manage stress, anxiety and depression at your own pace. We’re not about quick-fixes or false promises. We are about real progress, a day at a time.\n\n#1 - BuzzFeed's Amazing Apps For Anyone Living With Anxiety\n#1 - Forbes' 4 Technologies Innovating in Mental Health\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\n\"This app is not only beautiful and easy to use, it's also an incredibly useful tool that has genuinely changed my way of thinking when it comes to anxiety.\"\n\n\"I love that it randomly asks me how I'm feeling. I actually want to answer even when I'm feeling a little down. Selecting my mood and adding feelings to it is a really great reflection exercise.\"\n\n“Thank you so much for improving my quality of life. I suffer from depression and generalized anxiety disorder and your app helps me SO much!...I know I can do better and Pacifica motivates me to improve my eating habits (and to drink more water and less alcohol and coffee!).”\n\nDAILY MOOD TRACKER\nRate your mood (Awful to Great) and feelings (Happy, Anxious, Relaxed, etc.) throughout the day and see your improvement over time. You can add specific notes to these mood ratings too (the situation, the trigger, etc.) and review them via your mood history.\n\nRELAXATION & MINDFULNESS AUDIO TOOLS\nCalm yourself in moments of stress or anxiety using our audio exercises. Pacifica offers deep belly breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, positive visualization, mindfulness meditations, and more. These activities are set to relaxing soundscapes like ocean waves or thunderstorms.\n\nTHOUGHT ANALYSIS\nWhen your mind is racing, record your spoken thoughts and learn how your distorted thinking patterns contribute to your anxiety. Pacifica helps you to think in a more balanced way which helps break the thought cycle (based on CBT)\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES\nWhat could you do today that would cause you a little bit of anxiety? Pacifica helps you to face your anxiety, one day at a time, and gradually work toward your long term goals via daily experiments (based on CBT).\n\nDAILY HEALTH TRACKER\nSet and track your daily health goals for habits known to affect anxiety (like exercise, sleep, caffeine, alcohol and more). Learn which of these trigger your anxiety based on your mood history. Exercise, sleep and caffeine can also be populated using the Apple Health app.\n\nPRIVATE GROUPS\nChat and share Pacifica data with your friends, family or therapist. This includes mood history, thought records and completed experiments.\n\nPUBLIC COMMUNITIES\nShare stories/anecdotes/advice/news with the community and vote on your favorite content.\n\nPRICING & TERMS\nPacifica is free to download and use.

I’ve tried out several of these apps and this one is perfect. I get especially anxious at nighttime and can’t fall asleep, this app is so effective I don’t even know what it talks about because I’m out within the first 5-7 minutes. Life changing! It says that you start noticing results after a week, I felt calmer and more rested after listening to it for only a few days. Better than expected. Recommended to all my friends.\"\n\n\"Amazing. I started this more for serious stress that had under tones of anxiety. I really didn’t expect much out if it. Within a weeks time I was feeling calmer and better able to focus when issues did arise. Additionally I found that even when I couldn’t play this app- I found myself re-playing it’s principals in my head anyhow. In short it works. I am a believer. My head is clearer and things are getting back on track because of this app. Extremely pleased.\"\n\n\"Fantastic app. Love this app really working for me couldn’t recommend it highly enough !!!\"\n\n\"I have been experiencing a slow down at work for nearly 2 years. Thus, I’ve been home a lot more in these last two years. My son has some minor behavioral issues that have come to dominate our daily lives. I had found my self stresses, depressed, and angry all the time. I greeted every day with anxiety, dreading what new frustration it had to offer. I have been using this app for a little less than a week and I am already a lot happier and better able to roll with whatever comes up. I started this because I felt I was not being a good father or husband. I felt drawn more and more to find a pharmaceutical solution to this ever present sense of failure and anxiety. I don’t event give the use of substances a second thought now.\"\n\nTHE BEST ANTI-ANXIETY HYPNOSIS APP AVAILABLE\n\nEnd Anxiety Hypnosis is FREE and effective with the default settings.

Whether you’re experiencing symptoms of stress, feeling depressed or having anxiety attacks, Talkspace is the place for you. It’s also great for couples that need a new spark of motivation, to relieve tension and to increase positive feelings in their relationship. We will connect you with a dedicated, licensed therapist for on-demand, private text, audio, and video chat therapy, anywhere and anytime. All in the palm of your hand, on your phone or web browser!\n\nHOW DOES TALKSPACE WORK?\nTalkspace is easy. Anyone can start with a free consultation, so you can chat with a Matching Agent who will answer any questions and ultimately match you with a therapist based on a number of factors. As a Talkspace member, you will have access to your private counselor and secure chat room where you can discuss your life, ask questions and raise troubling issues. Your Talkspace therapist will check in with you based on your agreement with them (usually 1-2 times a day). \n\nTALKSPACE IN THE PRESS\n• “The process was identical to what I had experienced in traditional therapy, except that I had access to it anytime I pulled out my iPhone.” – Wall Street Journal\n• “Roughly 46 million Americans had a mental illness in 2011 but only 39% sought treatment. Barriers to seeking treatment include the cost, stigma, and time commitment. Talkspace aims to erase those barriers.” – CNN\n• “It’s really like texting. It’s easier to write out my feelings, rather than when you’re sitting in a room with someone and it’s hard to explain things.” – Mashable\n• “I spent 7 days with a therapist who only knew me via text message and I might never go back to traditional therapy again.” – Business Insider\n• “By keeping users anonymous, Talkspace hopes to alleviate the stigma that currently prevents 28% of people who need mental health care, but don’t receive treatment, from finding a therapist.” – The Verge\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nFor only $32 per week (billed monthly), Talkspace members gain unlimited access to a licensed therapist, free from appointments and the inconvenience of traveling or taking time off work. Our pricing plans are 80% lower than the average co-pay for traditional, in-office therapy appointments (which are usually only one hour long and twice a month). \n\nWHO ARE THE THERAPISTS?\nWe have over 1000 licensed therapists in the Talkspace network with thousands of years of combined medical experience! Our counselors’ backgrounds vary, specializing in issues that include: stress and anxiety, depression, LGBTQ issues, domestic violence, PTSD, repression, phobia, work/life issues, chronic illness, and many more. Each Talkspace counselor undergoes an extensive background check to ensure proper qualifications and a proven track record of providing excellent service and guidance. \n\nIS TEXT-THERAPY EFFECTIVE?\nSome studies show that online chat therapy is as effective as traditional therapy. Other research demonstrates that online therapy is sometimes more effective than face-to-face therapy, as text-messaging allows for more immediate care and higher engagement. \n\nIS TALKSPACE SAFE?\nAt Talkspace, your privacy and safety are always our first priority, so you don’t have to worry. We go to great lengths to ensure user data is kept secure and confidential. Our system is encrypted at the highest industry standards (Privacy Policy can be found at http://www.talkspace.com/public/privacypolicy). \n\nCONNECT WITH US\nWe are always happy to connect with users and receive feedback to help improve the app. \n• Email - support@talkspace.com \n• Website - Talkspace.com \n• Twitter - https://twitter.com/Talkspace \n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Talkspacetherapy","icon":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple62/v4/77/a8/55/77a85530-3a13-bab6-f277-87c75aa3b329/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["CA","CS","DA","NL","EN","FR","DE","EL","ID","IT","JA","KO","NB","NN","PL","PT","RU","ZH","ES","SV","ZH","TR","UK","VI"],"size":"66788352","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2013-07-11T17:51:11Z","updated":"2016-10-19T16:42:42Z","version":"5.5","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":661829389,"developer":"Groop Internet Platform inc.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/groop-internet-platform-inc./id661829389?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.talkspace.com","score":4,"reviews":1007,"currentVersionScore":4,"currentVersionReviews":40,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/82/56/5f/82565f4d-5ca9-66d9-ca12-0bb07d32ee5d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/39/67/e8/3967e84f-0af8-d836-bf99-ba58ddae3cc8/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/c0/99/4f/c0994f7d-40d4-f9f9-5e76-831e0fa4c3e3/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/fb/15/7d/fb157da5-fc7c-dbe0-cdb1-0e556f63225a/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/b6/2d/8c/b62d8cde-5d3e-88d0-6955-76a7a67720aa/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/44/98/99/449899e4-afe9-36ae-7f65-925465e0d98a/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/55/a6/99/55a69923-742a-c887-0b62-d742ff6101d9/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/a7/ae/21/a7ae21f0-6329-fd34-0662-9c1277071f1f/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/1d/f6/4d/1df64d10-771f-f6cd-b2d1-f61a6794c0f9/sc1024x768.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/7b/4f/2d/7b4f2d90-8fa5-c438-a352-9f52d3a450f0/sc1024x768.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":449889863,"appId":"com.hypnosisandsubliminal.happyapp","title":"Happy App - Beat Depression Anxiety & Stress, Guided Meditation & Hypnosis","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/happy-app-beat-depression/id449889863?mt=8&uo=4","description":"**Now includes an Unlock All in-app...unlock all hypnosis in-apps in your Store tab for one low price!**\n\nIt's time to be happy, motivated, and energized!

Tune your mind to help you with pain or depression.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nOnce you choose a particular frequency, such as the 'sleep' (brainwaves) frequency, this state is then more quickly achieved than normal. This is done by a mixing of tones sent to each ear - the difference between the two tones, that your brain creates, is called binaural entrainment. We also include isochronic entrainment, which is a different form, using a single pulsating tone in each ear - people who don't respond to binaurals, often respond to isochronics.\n\nTHE ONLY APP\nAmbiScience is the only app, which includes binaurals and isochronics in ONE. \n\nPROGRESSIVE ENTRAINMENT\nThis app also offers Progressive entrainment, which is a gradual inducement to your chosen entrainment (brainwaves), and this is done by starting at the waking state frequency and gradually moving the user down to his/her chosen frequency.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 20 LONG Professional Ambient Tracks\n- 13 Nature Sounds and Sound Samples\n- 6 BRAINWAVE/ENTRAINMENT PROGRAMS:\n-- 3 Isochronic Entrainment Tracks\n-- 3 Binaural Entrainment Tracks\nIncludes 2 Progressive Entrainment Tracks\n• Create your own CUSTOM programs\n• MULTITASKING background audio available!\n• PLAY YOUR iPod MUSIC with entrainment!\n• PERFECT Seamless Loops \n• Full-Featured presets / Multi-Track Save\n• Countdown Timer with fader\n• Countdown end chime\n• Alarm with Snooze option\n• Auto Quit/Exit feature\n• Adjustable independent volumes\n• Highest quality audio\n• Easy to use interface\n• Easy Instructions & Free Updates\n\nBRAINWAVE/ENTRAINMENT PROGRAMS:\n(headphones/earbuds or 2.1 speakers are RECOMMENDED - the iPhone/iPod speaker is not able to produce some of the frequencies below)\n- 6 Entrainment Programs\n• 25min.

Be Stronger. Proven results in just 10 minutes a day.\n \nSuperBetter increases resilience - the ability to stay strong, motivated and optimistic even in the face of difficult obstacles.  Playing SuperBetter makes you more capable of getting through any tough situation—and more likely to achieve the goals that matter most to you.\n \nSuperBetter was created by Jane McGonigal, a world-renowned designer of games to improve real lives & solve real problems.\n\n►► Why play SuperBetter?\n\nSuperBetter has helped nearly half a million people so far achieve personal growth and tackle real-life challenges. Here are reasons people around the world are using SuperBetter:\n\n- To adopt a new habit, develop a talent, learn or improve a skill, strengthen a relationship, make a physical or athletic breakthrough, complete a meaningful project, or pursue a lifelong dream.\n\n- To beat depression, overcome anxiety, cope with chronic illness or chronic pain, heal from physical injury, or recover from post-traumatic stress.\n\n- To overcome a life challenge like finding a new job, surviving divorce, dealing with a career or school setback, or grieving the loss of a loved one.\n\n- To help others: therapists recommend SuperBetter to their patients; university professors incorporate SuperBetter into their student’s coursework; and HR professionals design SuperBetter into their employee wellness incentive programs.  \n\n►► SuperBetter is Living Gamefully\n\n“At the heart of SUPERBETTER is a simple and potentially transformative idea: We can use the same psychological strengths we display when we play games to confront real-life challenges, whether it’s illness, injury, or just changing our habits for the better.”\n– Daniel H. Pink, bestselling author of Drive and A Whole New Mind\n\nLiving gamefully means bringing the same psychological strengths you naturally display when you play games – such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination – to your real life.  It means having the courage and openness to try out different strategies to discover what works best.  It means collaborating with allies, and building up the resilience to tackle tougher and tougher challenges with greater and greater success.\n\n►► The Science Behind SuperBetter\n\nPowered by the science of games, positive psychology and behavior change.\n\nSuperBetter is validated in two clinical studies:\n\n• A randomized controlled study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that playing SuperBetter for 30 days significantly reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, and increases optimism, social support, and player’s belief in their own ability to succeed and achieve their goals.  They also found that SuperBetter users were significantly happier and more satisfied with their lives.\n\n• A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital found that using SuperBetter improves mood, decreases anxiety and suffering, and strengthens family relationships during rehabilitation and recovery. \n\n►► Features\n\n• The SuperBetter app is an everyday coach for gameful living\n• Identify your Epic Win and create your Secret Identity \n• Recruit Allies to support your journey\n• Choose pre-loaded experiences (PowerPacks) or design your own adventures \n• Complete Quests, activate PowerUps and battle Bad Guys each day\n• Track your resilience scores – mental, emotional, social & physical\n\nLive Gamefully. Be Stronger. Get SuperBetter.","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/f2/88/9d/f2889dc7-6e0a-9d44-9e6a-e3f9a6e15591/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"20688896","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2012-06-28T03:07:44Z","updated":"2015-09-16T19:24:17Z","version":"1.1.2","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":1031294212,"developer":"SuperBetter, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/superbetter-llc/id1031294212?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.superbetter.com","score":4.5,"reviews":766,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":580,"screenshots":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/e3/d6/66/e3d666be-3d9a-fe44-42e6-d134120e2411/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/62/c0/a3/62c0a3f0-ee41-0270-0bf0-f2cdb67040f3/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e1/a3/94/e1a394ea-0a30-b31d-51b9-39bcb530421d/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/44/54/8a/44548ab2-6a95-4eac-d93d-bed93371da35/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/a8/14/22/a814220c-9b20-af44-1e24-177765e862e0/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":552797883,"appId":"relaxlite","title":"Complete Relaxation (Lite): Guided Meditation for a Happy, Stress Free Life","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/complete-relaxation-lite-guided/id552797883?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Using the latest meditation techniques, Complete Relaxation will ease every muscle in your body.

Even if you aren’t depressed it helps your mood and makes me think more clearly!!!! I am hooked for sure!!! Have recommended to several friends!\"\n\n\"I have been doing this self asteem app for just over five weeks. I feel different. I have noticed I’m more out spoken. And I’m going to places on my own again.Thanks !!\"\n\n\"It was very easy for me to visualize and focus on. I have used many other hypnosis apps but this one seems to be the best fit for me.\"\n\n\"I have downloaded most of their app. I feel an inner peace in moments of anxiety– like I can handle it, no matter what comes my way. I’ve been in therapy and medication for years now, and while I can’t say this is the cure it all, it certainly helps a great deal. You see, I’ve come to realize we often sabotage any attempt of change because it feels challenging– even when is for the better. It’s like our conscious mind sabotages our efforts subconsciously. Hypnosis works in a subtle, yet powerful way by sending affirmations to the subconscious– the part of us that doesn’t know right from wrong, only what we make it believe; it’s why our inner thoughts about ourselves become an integral part of how we see the self, not necessarily who we are. Thoughts are powerful and so is the subconscious. Definitely recommend.\"\n\nTHE BEST SELF-ESTEEM HYPNOSIS APP AVAILABLE\n\nSelf-Esteem Hypnosis is FREE and effective with the default settings.

That is exactly why Calmster was created. Multiple scientific studies show that meditation and mindfulness are utterly helpful in curing emotional disorders like depression, panic attacks, stress, PTSD and many others. Calmster was designed to introduce meditation and mindfulness practices into your life by periodically interjecting simple meditation assignments and mindfulness reminders into your everyday activities. These prompts will remind you to stay in the present moment leaving no chance for unwanted mental patterns to take over. Here are some of the benefits of mindful living: \n\n•\t Less stress, depression, pain and anxiety\n•\t Calmness, relaxation and balance\n•\t Better handling of feelings and emotions\n•\t Improved intuition, clarity and understanding\n• \t Control of thoughts and reactions\n•\t Better decision making, attention, memory and learning\n\nBUILD CONSCIOUSNESS AND MINDFULNESS MUSCLES TO FIGHT ANY EMOTIONAL DISORDERS\n\nMost of the emotional disorders happen due to lack of conscious control. That is how different unconscious patterns, which are mostly conflicting to each other, take over and start affecting our mood and behavior. The solution to this is simple – training the consciousness muscle to stay always present and notice how these patterns work and when they are triggered. Meditation and mindfulness practices in essence are designed to do just that - train and develop consciousness. In Calmster we have created series of meditation assignments and mindfulness reminders which will be coming to your phone throughout the day with a frequency that you configure in the app settings. These assignments and reminders will help you stay alert in the here and now leaving no chance for unwanted unconscious patterns to take over your moods and behavior. \n\nREGULAR PRACTICE\n\nThe more you practice meditation and mindfulness, in any possible way, the better and steadier will be your emotional wellbeing. Calmster is designed to help you in this practice without making you dependent on the app. Rather teaching you the skills and techniques so that you can implement them in your life on your own. Start leaving a better life now. Install Calmster on your phone.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/86/b9/20/86b920c0-0acf-38a6-b875-a071f4909f51/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PT","RU","ZH","ES"],"size":"10523648","requiredOsVersion":"7.0","released":"2016-01-07T15:31:18Z","updated":"2016-02-01T02:34:38Z","version":"1.0.2","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":886145249,"developer":"Levon Terteryan","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/levon-terteryan/id886145249?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://calmsterapp.com","screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/07/ab/7c/07ab7c06-b58c-a86b-cac0-f0493c6c1f10/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/56/c3/a1/56c3a179-08a8-596a-cd45-fe4fd06e4477/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/d0/2f/d0/d02fd082-aefc-349d-aef0-ec099b85d113/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ac/cf/b2/accfb217-2b48-8fd6-8bd8-bb6ae87532ad/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/be/4c/4d/be4c4da1-9d6d-48e6-2081-3f6a751364e9/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":564152606,"appId":"com.icanbeanything.beConfident","title":"I Can Be Confident","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/i-can-be-confident/id564152606?mt=8&uo=4","description":"★ Amazing! - It’s nice to hear someone, other than yourself cheer on you on.

This might help him or her to assess your condition.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple62/v4/c4/25/47/c42547d0-4bf3-00c3-2aa9-de3d5d6616a7/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6020","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"1420889","requiredOsVersion":"3.0","released":"2009-12-02T01:27:37Z","updated":"2009-12-02T01:27:37Z","version":"1.0","price":4.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":285623699,"developer":"Rogobete Christian","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/rogobete-christian/id285623699?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.soneso.com/soneso/Welcome/Entries/2010/2/27_Depression_Test.html","score":3,"reviews":54,"currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":54,"screenshots":["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/20/5e/ac/205eacf3-66ae-2a85-50da-b14292691a90/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/20/f3/8e/20f38ed0-1d2d-ee40-c5bb-df86aa34dd5b/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/20/46/83/204683a4-d307-f4aa-5147-2c78bd72bafc/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/8c/b6/f7/8cb6f72b-d9a0-6db8-3727-b7ec37a933df/screen320x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/4a/48/2a/4a482aa4-a7da-2fec-1cb1-bbc811a93254/screen320x480.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone","iPod-touch","iPod-touch-with-mic","iPhone-3G","iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":712791034,"appId":"com.cvz.dailytracker.pink","title":"Sleep Tracker+ Mood Diary","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-tracker+-mood-diary/id712791034?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Give your busy mind a break. With this app, you will never forget anything again.\n\n• Apple “New Year, New You” Favorite \n• Apple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nLumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life, such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. \n\n“I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza\n\nThe beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! \n\nInstead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. \n\nDesigned exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.\n\nSo what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? \n\nTrack it and get things done!\n\n:: Note to iPhone 6s & 6s Plus users \n\nNow you can ask Siri to find information for you and dictate right into Lumen Trails. For example, hold down the Home button and ask Siri: “How many calories are in a chicken sandwich?”. To start dictation, tap the microphone button on your keyboard and just start talking - your words will be turned into text. \n\n:: Have a Question? \n\nWe are here to help.

Keeping this app updated and running on all iOS devices is a challenge but I think we've gotten them taken care of\n+ iPhone 6/6+ support\n+ graphing data across time\n+ on device PDF viewing\n+ daily reminders\n+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.\n\nRead what our actual users say:\n\n\"***** Best DBT app available!!!\nSimply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service.","icon":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple18/v4/26/7c/60/267c60d4-5ef0-3664-02a6-13c97c59fbdb/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Medical"],"genreIds":["6013","6020"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"12+","languages":["EN"],"size":"57291776","requiredOsVersion":"7.1","released":"2011-11-14T16:18:20Z","updated":"2016-07-08T15:03:25Z","version":"3.4","price":4.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":479013893,"developer":"Durham DBT, Inc.","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/durham-dbt-inc./id479013893?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.diarycard.net","score":4,"reviews":153,"currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":8,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/d9/1c/ed/d91cedef-ae97-519c-c120-c28e9841f951/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/60/c4/77/60c477a0-d666-5e27-abf9-fcd29e6ddaa8/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/d4/af/ad/d4afade7-83d8-72ca-9fb4-db234ec62a6c/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/6d/89/db/6d89dbda-491c-2f51-aacf-a10cf335b8b9/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/6c/94/0b/6c940bea-460b-7bc0-d0d3-2c26d5a48215/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/05/9c/81/059c81bd-065c-4be5-9a8f-5385ac9a8d26/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/b4/83/21/b483219c-1929-b789-d474-80c9894247a4/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/12/01/e0/1201e0cb-61d7-c4e2-aaa0-75da27748640/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/3d/b1/c0/3db1c04b-0fae-daf7-8940-9e80a6d6ac50/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/c5/50/14/c550147b-3745-4049-323c-140fd5425fed/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":896939537,"appId":"com.goodbarber.crsummit","title":"Celebrate Recovery","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/celebrate-recovery/id896939537?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Celebrate Recovery is a biblical and balanced program that helps us overcome our hurts, hang-ups, and habits.","icon":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/71/4b/1f/714b1f88-ad39-d24f-86fb-ad4993f22d98/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6012"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"51571712","requiredOsVersion":"7.0","released":"2014-07-18T02:56:47Z","updated":"2015-12-05T04:21:28Z","version":"2.0","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":896939540,"developer":"Bobbi McWilliams","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bobbi-mcwilliams/id896939540?uo=4","score":4.5,"reviews":53,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/1a/6d/cb/1a6dcbf9-83b6-d1f1-0469-349634f0e851/screen696x696.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone4","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":941140783,"appId":"uk.co.positiverewards.feelgood","title":"Feeling good: audio course for depression & stress","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feeling-good-audio-course/id941140783?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Increase your good feelings, your everyday wellbeing and your resilience to stress through listening to these audio recordings.

As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. \n\n2). \"Smoking Cessation\" \n\nYou will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. \n\n3). \"Smoke-Free Sleep Track\" \n\nStart listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit.

We can get caught in a negative-thought loop where it feels like there’s no hope.\n\nIf you or anyone you know might be suffering from smiling depression, the good news is help is available. This is one of the most treatable mental health problems. Whether through counseling or psychotherapy, it is possible to successfully navigate out of this state of mind and be freed from the sadness. Your loved one or close friend whom you suspect is suffering from smiling depression may deny it and might even have a negative reaction when you first broach the subject. This is normal. Often people aren’t aware of smiling depression and the word “depression” might sound too extreme. Keep in mind they may view getting help as a sign of weakness or something only needed by the severely disturbed.\n\nWe have answers for every important issue, symptoms of depression, depression medication, causes, prevention and depression treatment.

With the JUVÉDERM® Treatment Visualizer you are not just able to visualize how you may look with JUVÉDERM® treatment, but also learn potential questions to ask your doctor and treatment tips that will help you and your doctor at your JUVÉDERM® treatment consultation. And if you don’t have a doctor, don’t worry, as the app will help you find a doctor too. \n\nBy simulating the results of JUVÉDERM® treatment, the JUVÉDERM® Treatment Visualizer is the optimal tool to help you decide if you should talk to a doctor about JUVÉDERM® treatment. This app is for demonstrative purposes only. Results may vary.\n\nJUVÉDERM® XC Important Information\n\nIndication\n\nJUVÉDERM® injectable gel is injected into areas of facial tissue where moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds occur to temporarily add volume to the skin, which may give the appearance of a smoother surface.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nYour physician will ask about your medical history to determine if you are an appropriate candidate for treatment. The product should not be used in patients who have:\n\n- Severe allergies marked by a history of anaphylaxis or history or presence of multiple severe allergies\n- A history of allergies to lidocaine or Gram-positive bacterial proteins\n\nThe safety and effectiveness for the treatment of areas other than facial wrinkles and folds (such as lips) have not been established in controlled clinical studies.\n\nThe following are important treatment considerations for you to discuss with your physician and understand in order to help avoid unsatisfactory results and complications:\n\n- Patients who are using substances that can prolong bleeding, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, as with any injection, may experience increased bruising or bleeding at injection site. You should inform your physician before treatment if you are using these types of substances\n- If laser treatment, chemical peeling, or any other procedure based on active dermal response is considered after treatment with JUVÉDERM®, there is a possible risk of an inflammatory reaction at the treatment site\n- JUVÉDERM® injectable gel should be used with caution in patients on immunosuppressive therapy, or therapy used to decrease the body’s immune response, as there may be an increased risk of infection\n- The safety for use during pregnancy, in breast-feeding females, or in patients under 18 years has not been established\n- The safety in patients with a history of excessive scarring (e.g., hypertrophic scarring and keloid formations) and pigmentation disorders has not been studied\n\nMost side effects are mild or moderate in nature, and their duration is short lasting (7 days or less). The most common side effects include, but are not limited to, temporary injection-site reactions such as: redness, pain/tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps/bumps, bruising, itching, and discoloration.\n\nAs with all skin-injection procedures, there is a risk of infection.\n\nTo report a problem with JUVÉDERM®, please call Allergan Product Surveillance at 1-800-624-4261.\n\nJUVÉDERM® injectable gel is available by prescription only.\n\n©2013 Allergan, Inc. ® and ™ marks owned by Allergan, Inc.

I’ve tried out several of these apps and this one is perfect. I get especially anxious at nighttime and can’t fall asleep, this app is so effective I don’t even know what it talks about because I’m out within the first 5-7 minutes. Life changing! It says that you start noticing results after a week, I felt calmer and more rested after listening to it for only a few days. Better than expected. Recommended to all my friends.\"\n\n\"Amazing. I started this more for serious stress that had under tones of anxiety. I really didn’t expect much out if it. Within a weeks time I was feeling calmer and better able to focus when issues did arise. Additionally I found that even when I couldn’t play this app- I found myself re-playing it’s principals in my head anyhow. In short it works. I am a believer. My head is clearer and things are getting back on track because of this app. Extremely pleased.\"\n\n\"Fantastic app. Love this app really working for me couldn’t recommend it highly enough !!!\"\n\n\"I have been experiencing a slow down at work for nearly 2 years. Thus, I’ve been home a lot more in these last two years. My son has some minor behavioral issues that have come to dominate our daily lives. I had found my self stresses, depressed, and angry all the time. I greeted every day with anxiety, dreading what new frustration it had to offer. I have been using this app for a little less than a week and I am already a lot happier and better able to roll with whatever comes up. I started this because I felt I was not being a good father or husband. I felt drawn more and more to find a pharmaceutical solution to this ever present sense of failure and anxiety. I don’t event give the use of substances a second thought now.\"\n\nTHE BEST ANTI-ANXIETY HYPNOSIS APP AVAILABLE\n\nEnd Anxiety Hypnosis is FREE and effective with the default settings.

The information in this report updates the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2010;59 [No. RR–12]). These updated guidelines discuss 1) alternative treatment regimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 2) the use of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis; 3) alternative treatment options for genital warts; 4) the role of Mycoplasma genitalium in urethritis/cervicitis and treatment-related implications; 5) updated HPV vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) the management of persons who are transgender; 7) annual testing for hepatitis C in persons with HIV infection; 8) updated recommendations for diagnostic evaluation of urethritis; and 9) retesting to detect repeat infection. Physicians and other health-care providers can use these guidelines to assist in the prevention and treatment of STDs.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nTHE MATERIALS EMBODIED IN THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS-IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In order to use AirStrip Cardiology, your healthcare facility must have purchased and installed AirStrip Cardiology. For more information, please visit www.airstriptech.com \n\nAlso part of the AirStrip ONE enterprise healthcare mobility solution, AirStrip Cardiology is a pioneering mobile solution that allows clinicians to review the extent of a patient’s ECG history and completely changes the way that cardiac waveform data can be viewed, reviewed, analyzed and interacted with. \n\nIn simplest terms, AirStrip Cardiology will allow for more timely and more accurate diagnosis and treatment of the cardiac patient; whether in the pre-hospital or in-patient space. Furthermore, AirStrip Cardiology allows for unprecedented collaboration between Emergency Medical Systems, Emergency Department and Cardiology teams – especially when transporting potential AMI and STEMI patients. \n\nAirStrip Cardiology provides a native application from which the original ECG data is rebuilt with sharp, full detail at the highest possible resolution - no more muddy-looking faxes, emails or PDF’s. The core features of AirStrip Cardiology are the following: \n\n-Users can receive 12 lead ECG waveforms and other data wirelessly from Emergency Medical Services (i.e. an ambulance) and the hospital ECG management system. \n\n-Users can access and interact with this data anytime, anywhere on their mobile device via the native AirStrip application using a cellular connection or Wi-Fi. \n\n-Users can see clear and accurate waveforms and can detect differences of less than .05 millivolts (.5 millimeter). \n\n-AirStrip mobilizes ALL 10 seconds of the digital information obtained from the 12 lead ECG sources; not just the three seconds chosen by the ECG machine. \n\n-Users can simultaneously scroll through a full 10 seconds for all leads while retaining the traditional 12-lead layout. \n\n-The compound zooming feature allows for a “pinch zoom” functionality for the 12-leads which allows for a visual clarity of 1/10th of a millimeter while retaining the traditional 12-lead comparison layout. This means the system maintains perspective of the view in all leads while the user is focused on pinching and zooming on one lead. The aspect ratios are always preserved. \n\n-Users can see a full presentation of analysis algorithms for 12 leads. \n\n-Users can readily access, review and compare past ECGs by comparing the full 12-lead view or comparing individual leads between two ECG's side by side. \n\n-Users can set any of the leads as the rhythm strip, see all available beats and control which beats will be used for the analysis. \n\n-Users can quickly define which leads they want to compare in a 10 second, stacked view analysis. \n\n-Users can use the Measurement Tables to perform detailed analysis and review of electrophysiological parameters and measurements of the lead (waveform) data.","icon":"http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/2d/51/62/2d51628b-433b-f356-8600-ba62c6a043af/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Medical"],"genreIds":["6020"],"primaryGenre":"Medical","primaryGenreId":6020,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"113348608","requiredOsVersion":"6.0","released":"2011-01-22T00:55:08Z","updated":"2015-09-22T19:58:34Z","version":"1.1.9","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":309381243,"developer":"AirStrip Technologies, LLC","developerUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/airstrip-technologies-llc/id309381243?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.airstrip.com","score":3.5,"reviews":23,"screenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/bb/1a/f4/bb1af45b-e48d-694b-9c9d-755545430d4f/screen322x572.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/9b/b0/ca/9bb0ca29-314d-dbcc-280b-57bf77ac0b15/screen322x572.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/42/cd/a2/42cda287-958d-b09c-58f9-380bc747cc2e/screen322x572.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/9b/7e/ef/9b7eef99-8222-25c0-ede5-e7c119453475/screen322x572.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshots":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a7/45/6f/a7456f88-0ef2-da75-b65f-03de0be0818e/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/4b/d9/9c/4bd99cfe-69b8-19f6-b0d0-a256a0d9082b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c1/0f/26/c10f260e-0f60-9425-1991-bb68908ad06b/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/49/27/5e/49275e48-37ef-a9f0-207f-bd1970a53e31/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/17/1f/84/171f84f2-9a96-e815-7a8a-52b56e44f15c/screen480x480.jpeg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"]},{"id":908860329,"appId":"com.sprucehealth.Patient-Live","title":"Spruce - your online dermatologist","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spruce-your-online-dermatologist/id908860329?mt=8&uo=4","description":"Online visits with board-certified US dermatologists.

Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. \n\nIf you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. \n\nLet's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: \n\n1). \"Quit Smoking- Preparation\" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)\n\nListen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. \n\n2). \"Smoking Cessation\" \n\nYou will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. \n\n3). \"Smoke-Free Sleep Track\" \n\nStart listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit.
