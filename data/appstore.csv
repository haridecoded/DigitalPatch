We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.By using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, e.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We can also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,"DA,NL,EN,FR,DE,IT,JA,KO,PL,PT,RU,ES,SV",40623684,4.3,2010-02-02T22:13:22Z,2012-08-15T18:56:27Z,2.1,0,USD,true,344500276,On Beat Limited,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4,4,53,4.5,22,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg,,,"iPhone-3GS,iPadWifi,iPad3G,iPodTouchThirdGen,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

If you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. If you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. Let's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: 1). ""Quit Smoking- Preparation"" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)Listen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. 2). ""Smoking Cessation"" You will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. 3). ""Smoke-Free Sleep Track"" Start listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! 4).

Meditation can be the help and support that you need to quit that habit. A Yale University research study confirms the benefits of Mindfulness and mediation when it comes to quitting an addiction.  The research shows that 30% of people who practice meditation to quit smoking did not smoke a single cigarette in the first week of training, versus the 6% of people who used traditional methods to quit smoking.An addicted brain is a brain with a great load of stress; it´s a brain that works too fast. Meditation gets the brain to relax and reduces the excess of its activity. Most smokers know that tobacco is bad for their health; if they don’t quit, it´s because they don´t have the necessary means and tools to say no. Meditation and Mindfulness will provide the necessary resources to quit smoking Adaptable to new iPhone 5 and iPad Mini This application will help you to: Gain the willpower necessary to avoid tobaccoCalm down before smoking so your anxiety doesn´t control you.Become aware of how disgusting tobacco smoke is (something the smoker has forgotten over time)Avoid automation of smoking; you will quit smoking in “auto pilot”Scientific studies:""Meditate daily for 8 weeks make significant changes in brain regions associated with memory, wellbeing and stress.

NO PURCHASE REQUIRED!Over 2 MILLION Jason Vale books sold worldwide and creator of the No.1 BEST-SELLING APP '7lbs in 7 Days: super juice diet’ *STOP SMOKING IN 2 HOURS requires NO WILLPOWER...NO GUMS OR PATCHES...NO GIMMICKS... Just a Simple Way to Freedom.Addiction and health author Jason Vale ran a ""Stop Smoking"" clinic for 9 years and successfully helped thousands of people to become smoke-free.  Jason used to smoke 40-60 cigarettes a day himself, until he learnt the secret to stopping in 1995, and hasn’t smoked since! Now, YOU can learn Jason’s secret from his tried and tested programme from the convenience of your own iPhone / iPod / iPad. Jason is literally in your pocket every step of the way!Stop Smoking in Just 2 hours and remain Free for Life!  There are only 2 simple steps:1) Watch the short opening video2) Listen to the two 1 hour audio sessionsThat’s it, you are now FREE - it's that easy!  Extra BONUS material includes:* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the ""5 day adjustment period""* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for lifeJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”Jason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”Appdiction Review:""Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.""",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,12+,EN,349286400,7.1,2012-01-23T04:33:18Z,2016-01-08T23:40:59Z,2.1.0,0,USD,true,493242642,Juice Master,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4,4.5,24,5,7,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.  You will hardly notice you've cut back until you've quit.  There is also a motivation and tip section for when you are feeling weak or you are slipping off your schedule.  The app also keeps track of some very interesting statistics including averages, maximums, minimums, saved money, saved tar and nicotine levels and more.  Even if you aren't ready to quit, get this app and run it for a while, then check the stats and you may just change your mind.- keep track of money, smokes, nicotine and more- quit at your own pace with many options to tailor to your situation- manually add or remove smokes for when you forget- motivation and tips for when you are feeling weak",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e2/91/23/e291236c-2220-af5d-df62-be5851baef12/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,EN,3641344,6.0,2011-09-13T22:25:56Z,2014-04-20T02:27:56Z,2.3.0,0,USD,true,375591377,Snappy Appz Inc.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/snappy-appz-inc./id375591377?uo=4,,,3,1,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/85/3b/98/853b9830-e56f-c312-cff7-ccddf41aa3bd/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/a3/4e/daa34ee5-ab5d-db26-d9e6-ec5daeb1608c/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a1/ae/40/a1ae4065-e404-8bf1-02f7-a2fc6d99d730/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/68/53/3a/68533ad2-819b-a62e-228c-fcdfe82cc7e7/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone-3GS,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!Stop smoking now to avoid insurance hikes.

I found it not only easy but unbelievably enjoyable to stay stopped.” – Sir Anthony Hopkins“Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking program achieved for me a thing that I thought was not possible – to give up a thirty-year smoking habit literally overnight. It was nothing short of a miracle.” – Anjelica Huston",http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/20/a8/4b/20a84b94-9dba-a731-6916-b7f5f8b962a0/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,17+,EN,6193152,6.0,2012-12-19T22:11:05Z,2015-01-30T18:37:58Z,1.3,6.99,USD,false,585624867,Arcturus Digital LTD,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/arcturus-digital-ltd/id585624867?uo=4,4.5,20,4.5,6,"http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9b/51/a2/9b51a24b-b1c5-d75b-8659-bf2d4a2f9509/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/82/89/4b/82894bc2-7623-35f8-64fc-b0da11d61fc7/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/95/85/1f/95851fe3-ae67-349d-f3a1-15ca5c0fc261/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/af/a3/c0/afa3c0f7-9a53-1125-3281-ff669088e91d/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/a7/92/11/a792110c-6acc-94ae-aa90-6f1c18b816af/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/2f/39/66/2f396618-7df4-ceec-7395-e7fcaeb5f398/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone-3GS,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.Successful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  The app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine.

Stopping smoking through willpower alone is almost impossible because you’ve trained your brain to automatically prompt you to smoke at certain key moments. But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way. Tim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way. Part One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking. Part Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why.  Part Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation. Part Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again. Your progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing. You’ll be amazed by how quickly you start to enjoy the benefits of being a non-smoker.",http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/77/3f/2f/773f2fcf-8fcb-1ce9-4854-cb1ca783d27a/source/512x512bb.jpg,Health & Fitness,6013,Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,46960640,7.1,2014-11-25T14:11:40Z,2015-06-30T02:16:24Z,1.2.2,0,USD,true,930436697,The Stop Switch,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-stop-switch/id930436697?uo=4,,,,,"http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/60/bf/58/60bf58a0-f8db-e981-8afd-ff78deb496d7/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/74/58/c5/7458c53b-844a-6ecc-d865-3b3079c7de1b/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d8/db/8d/d8db8d93-a790-8a86-319a-2bc3e2ccd5b5/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/6c/1f/60/6c1f60c6-0751-3406-4b3a-ea0c8df54df6/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/bf/e8/85/bfe8850a-7d98-27f0-4ba2-75d75d6fa113/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

You smell like smoke constantlyNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!2. You age quickerYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!3. Your sense of smell and taste declineBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. 4. Your social networkBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!5. Smaller dating poolAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.6. ImpotenceSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. 7. Chances of infection are increasedFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.8. Dangers to othersSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?9. Decreased physical activityMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved. Smoking causes the lungs and heart to work harder, which decreases cardiovascular abilities. 10. Cost of smoking cigarettes Just on cigarettes alone, the average smoker can spend $3,000 a year on cigarettes. If that isn’t enough to sway your opinion, think about the well being risks that you will inevitably be paying for down the road.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/4f/24/90/4f249088-aa14-5b22-592d-462930a2f322/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,17+,EN,50624512,8.1,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,1.0,0,USD,true,953610384,"App Diggity, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4,,,,,"http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/bc/52/9a/bc529a7d-6016-c9c1-c838-7bf2f5f2faed/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/79/a9/b7/79a9b76f-6780-ae0c-9cf7-2e262285c5e8/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2a/d6/8e/2ad68e70-bdb6-8bf6-3b77-b53be2f2540a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/73/79/83/7379836d-c236-740a-e36a-3f87009c6df0/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ef/50/9e/ef509e18-b6e4-752a-fe3f-5e5576ffddc4/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ba/03/e5/ba03e579-69de-97b3-df33-227994c03bd2/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/83/b1/e8/83b1e821-2cc3-7928-c29b-aff65644a046/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2b/10/7f/2b107f26-f410-9a37-deb2-d8307902b491/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b8/3a/5c/b83a5c58-0200-60b1-bc5e-b8ab4123116c/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/fc/69/db/fc69db8f-f5b0-c389-2a85-f89545e1b45f/sc1024x768.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

335619210,com.ican-hypnosis.stopsmoking,iCan Stop Smoking: learn self hypnosis and quit smoking,https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ican-stop-smoking-learn-self/id335619210?mt=8&uo=4,"Stop smoking todayThe cost of a hypnotherapy download is minimal compared with the cost of continuing to smoke...and we're not talking about the real costs here.  And the benefits of quitting are almost immediate - few days after stopping, the nicotine is out of your system - and if that were all there was to stopping, that would be fine because most smokers agree with Mark Twain that stopping smoking is not the problem, '...it's  easy,' he said, 'I've done it thousands of times.'No, the problem is not to stop smoking but to stay stopped! ...and how do you do that? - only by really dealing with the underlying psychological problem of cigarette and nicotine addiction. This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.Hypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.Hypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.And the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.So it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.It may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.Two days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.Long term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.In the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,12333056,8.0,2009-10-29T07:00:00Z,2015-10-16T12:37:44Z,2.0,2.99,USD,false,335619213,iCan Hypnosis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4,3.5,35,,,"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. Log your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. All this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.We proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effectiveThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow.

If you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. If you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. Let's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: 1). ""Quit Smoking- Preparation"" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)Listen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. 2). ""Smoking Cessation"" You will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. 3). ""Smoke-Free Sleep Track"" Start listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! 4). ""Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster"" This short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes. Listen to this to address any cravings that may come up, for any situations that may have triggered you to smoke in the past, and to quickly reinforce your reasons for releasing cigarettes and smoking from your life.

335619210,com.ican-hypnosis.stopsmoking,iCan Stop Smoking: learn self hypnosis and quit smoking,https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ican-stop-smoking-learn-self/id335619210?mt=8&uo=4,"Stop smoking todayThe cost of a hypnotherapy download is minimal compared with the cost of continuing to smoke...and we're not talking about the real costs here.  And the benefits of quitting are almost immediate - few days after stopping, the nicotine is out of your system - and if that were all there was to stopping, that would be fine because most smokers agree with Mark Twain that stopping smoking is not the problem, '...it's  easy,' he said, 'I've done it thousands of times.'No, the problem is not to stop smoking but to stay stopped! ...and how do you do that? - only by really dealing with the underlying psychological problem of cigarette and nicotine addiction. This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.Hypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.Hypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.And the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.So it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.It may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.Two days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.Long term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.In the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,12333056,8.0,2009-10-29T07:00:00Z,2015-10-16T12:37:44Z,2.0,2.99,USD,false,335619213,iCan Hypnosis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4,3.5,35,,,"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

The app will take care of the rest for you.The method will let you gradually lower your number of cigarettes and give you a solid ground to not fall back into your old habits again.HOW IT WORKSThe first days you smoke as usual and register every cigarette.

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.By using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, e.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We can also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,"DA,NL,EN,FR,DE,IT,JA,KO,PL,PT,RU,ES,SV",40623684,4.3,2010-02-02T22:13:22Z,2012-08-15T18:56:27Z,2.1,0,USD,true,344500276,On Beat Limited,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4,4,53,4.5,22,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg,,,"iPhone-3GS,iPadWifi,iPad3G,iPodTouchThirdGen,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

It is intended to serve as a source of readily available support and information for adults who are already in treatment to quit smoking - - to help them stay quit even after treatment ends.  The app guides users in creating a tailored plan that takes into account their personal reasons for quitting. It provides information about smoking and quitting, interactive tools to help users cope with urges to smoke, and motivational messages and support contacts to help users stay smoke-free.Stay Quit Coach is based on the smoking treatment manual “Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation: Treatment for Veterans with PTSD,” which was written by Miles McFall and Andrew Saxon in collaboration with David Kalman and Timothy Carmody. This treatment is based on evidence-based clinical practices, and has been shown to double quit rates of military veterans with PTSD. Stay Quit Coach was the result of a collaborative effort among the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD), the VA Sierra Pacific (VISN 21) Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Clinical Public Health Group (CPH) and the Department of Defense National Center for Telehealth & Technology (T2).  Additional partners include the VA Puget Sound Health Care System and Northwest (VISN 20) MIRECC, and VA Mid-Atlantic (VISN 6) MIRECC.",http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple2/v4/29/01/a9/2901a914-28d5-1ae3-fd90-6530ca22d9e6/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,EN,6803456,4.3,2013-05-30T20:50:47Z,2013-05-30T20:50:47Z,1.0,0,USD,true,430646305,US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/us-department-veterans-affairs/id430646305?uo=4,5,9,5,9,"http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fe/00/53/fe0053af-f204-adc9-7994-2119d12b9d67/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/f0/b2/be/f0b2beda-99f2-a129-7340-b68653059e17/screen568x568.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/48/9a/19/489a192c-659b-e9e6-20fa-721e43888b17/screen568x568.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/b9/52/0e/b9520e34-70d1-9e6a-4b9c-07aeb2c40792/screen568x568.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/00/0e/71/000e71a9-bce3-813f-756d-3e185e30e0c5/screen568x568.jpeg",,,"iPhone-3GS,iPadWifi,iPad3G,iPodTouchThirdGen,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Get this application for free ***Stop smoking is not easy. In our application 'Quit Smoking Secrets' you can find tips which may help you to quit smoking.Smokers may have started smoking because their friends did or because it seemed cool. But they keep on smoking because they became addicted to nicotine, one of the chemicals in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.Nicotine is both a stimulant and a depressant. That means it increases the heart rate at first and makes people feel more alert (like caffeine, another stimulant). Then it causes depression and fatigue. The depression and fatigue and the drug withdrawal from nicotine make people crave another cigarette to perk up again. According to many experts, the nicotine in tobacco is as addictive as cocaine or heroin.It's true, for most people quitting isn't easy. After all, the nicotine in cigarettes is a powerfully addictive drug.

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.By using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, e.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We can also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all.

If you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. If you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. Let's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: 1). ""Quit Smoking- Preparation"" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)Listen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. 2). ""Smoking Cessation"" You will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. 3). ""Smoke-Free Sleep Track"" Start listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! 4). ""Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster"" This short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes. Listen to this to address any cravings that may come up, for any situations that may have triggered you to smoke in the past, and to quickly reinforce your reasons for releasing cigarettes and smoking from your life.

Meditation can be the help and support that you need to quit that habit. A Yale University research study confirms the benefits of Mindfulness and mediation when it comes to quitting an addiction.  The research shows that 30% of people who practice meditation to quit smoking did not smoke a single cigarette in the first week of training, versus the 6% of people who used traditional methods to quit smoking.An addicted brain is a brain with a great load of stress; it´s a brain that works too fast. Meditation gets the brain to relax and reduces the excess of its activity. Most smokers know that tobacco is bad for their health; if they don’t quit, it´s because they don´t have the necessary means and tools to say no. Meditation and Mindfulness will provide the necessary resources to quit smoking Adaptable to new iPhone 5 and iPad Mini This application will help you to: Gain the willpower necessary to avoid tobaccoCalm down before smoking so your anxiety doesn´t control you.Become aware of how disgusting tobacco smoke is (something the smoker has forgotten over time)Avoid automation of smoking; you will quit smoking in “auto pilot”Scientific studies:""Meditate daily for 8 weeks make significant changes in brain regions associated with memory, wellbeing and stress.

Just a Simple Way to Freedom.Addiction and health author Jason Vale ran a ""Stop Smoking"" clinic for 9 years and successfully helped thousands of people to become smoke-free.  Jason used to smoke 40-60 cigarettes a day himself, until he learnt the secret to stopping in 1995, and hasn’t smoked since! Now, YOU can learn Jason’s secret from his tried and tested programme from the convenience of your own iPhone / iPod / iPad.

Extra BONUS material includes:* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the ""5 day adjustment period""* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for lifeJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”Jason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”Appdiction Review:""Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.""",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,12+,EN,349286400,7.1,2012-01-23T04:33:18Z,2016-01-08T23:40:59Z,2.1.0,0,USD,true,493242642,Juice Master,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4,4.5,24,5,7,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Stopping smoking through willpower alone is almost impossible because you’ve trained your brain to automatically prompt you to smoke at certain key moments. But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way. Tim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way. Part One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking. Part Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why.  Part Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation. Part Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again. Your progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing. You’ll be amazed by how quickly you start to enjoy the benefits of being a non-smoker.",http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/77/3f/2f/773f2fcf-8fcb-1ce9-4854-cb1ca783d27a/source/512x512bb.jpg,Health & Fitness,6013,Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,46960640,7.1,2014-11-25T14:11:40Z,2015-06-30T02:16:24Z,1.2.2,0,USD,true,930436697,The Stop Switch,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-stop-switch/id930436697?uo=4,,,,,"http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/60/bf/58/60bf58a0-f8db-e981-8afd-ff78deb496d7/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/74/58/c5/7458c53b-844a-6ecc-d865-3b3079c7de1b/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d8/db/8d/d8db8d93-a790-8a86-319a-2bc3e2ccd5b5/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/6c/1f/60/6c1f60c6-0751-3406-4b3a-ea0c8df54df6/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/bf/e8/85/bfe8850a-7d98-27f0-4ba2-75d75d6fa113/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.3.    Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.Successful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  The app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!Quit smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers.

You smell like smoke constantlyNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!2. You age quickerYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!3. Your sense of smell and taste declineBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. 4. Your social networkBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!5. Smaller dating poolAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.6. ImpotenceSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. 7. Chances of infection are increasedFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.8. Dangers to othersSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?9. Decreased physical activityMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved. Smoking causes the lungs and heart to work harder, which decreases cardiovascular abilities. 10. Cost of smoking cigarettes Just on cigarettes alone, the average smoker can spend $3,000 a year on cigarettes. If that isn’t enough to sway your opinion, think about the well being risks that you will inevitably be paying for down the road.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/4f/24/90/4f249088-aa14-5b22-592d-462930a2f322/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,17+,EN,50624512,8.1,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,1.0,0,USD,true,953610384,"App Diggity, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4,,,,,"http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/bc/52/9a/bc529a7d-6016-c9c1-c838-7bf2f5f2faed/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/79/a9/b7/79a9b76f-6780-ae0c-9cf7-2e262285c5e8/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2a/d6/8e/2ad68e70-bdb6-8bf6-3b77-b53be2f2540a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/73/79/83/7379836d-c236-740a-e36a-3f87009c6df0/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ef/50/9e/ef509e18-b6e4-752a-fe3f-5e5576ffddc4/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ba/03/e5/ba03e579-69de-97b3-df33-227994c03bd2/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/83/b1/e8/83b1e821-2cc3-7928-c29b-aff65644a046/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2b/10/7f/2b107f26-f410-9a37-deb2-d8307902b491/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b8/3a/5c/b83a5c58-0200-60b1-bc5e-b8ab4123116c/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/fc/69/db/fc69db8f-f5b0-c389-2a85-f89545e1b45f/sc1024x768.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

335619210,com.ican-hypnosis.stopsmoking,iCan Stop Smoking: learn self hypnosis and quit smoking,https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ican-stop-smoking-learn-self/id335619210?mt=8&uo=4,"Stop smoking todayThe cost of a hypnotherapy download is minimal compared with the cost of continuing to smoke...and we're not talking about the real costs here.  And the benefits of quitting are almost immediate - few days after stopping, the nicotine is out of your system - and if that were all there was to stopping, that would be fine because most smokers agree with Mark Twain that stopping smoking is not the problem, '...it's  easy,' he said, 'I've done it thousands of times.'No, the problem is not to stop smoking but to stay stopped! ...and how do you do that? - only by really dealing with the underlying psychological problem of cigarette and nicotine addiction. This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.Hypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.Hypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.And the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.So it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.It may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.Two days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.Long term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.In the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,12333056,8.0,2009-10-29T07:00:00Z,2015-10-16T12:37:44Z,2.0,2.99,USD,false,335619213,iCan Hypnosis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4,3.5,35,,,"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Smoking Marijuana overloads your serotonin receptors and decreases your motivation to meet new people. This can destroy your life if you let it. Don't let Marijuana addiction get the best of you. Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.Take a look at our top 10 reasons to quit marijuana:1. You will have a clear mind For many lifelong smokers, this is the number one reason to quit smoking. If you are finding yourself forgetting simple things and having your mind in a fog for several hours to days after smoking, then quitting marijuana might be the right thing to do.  2. Being Ambitious  Many people with bright futures have reported that marijuana use destroys their ambition. They come up with interesting ideas when they are high, but don't have the motivation to push through when the time comes. They end up being very complacent and don't live up to their full potential. 3. Being Energetic As you age, marijuana starts to take a toll on your body in many ways. Smoking pot to overcome mundane tasks is why you may have started in the first place, but after a while, your lungs will start to clog and your blood flow will slow.  4. Having better eating habits Everyone knows that smoking marijuana speeds up your metabolism, which in turn makes you very hungry. This is commonly known as the munchies. No matter what type of foods you are eating, you are still putting a damper on your overall health and digestive tract. 5. Having clean lungs There has been conflicting research about the negative effects of smoking weed, but the unanimous agreement is that you are still inhaling smoke. Chronic use can lead to emphysema, cancer, and other serious health issues. 6. Living life by the laws The longer you smoke weed, the more chances you have of running into trouble with the law. Sure, the growing trend of legalization makes us more brazen about marijuana smoking, but possession is still illegal in most states and STILL a federal crime no matter what.  7. Personal safety Is your drug dealer really your friend? He may appear to be, but somewhere along his supply chain, there is some serious illegal activity going on. People who engage in illegal activity are more likely to commit violent crimes which you don't want to be caught in the middle of. 8. Save your money I think this goes without saying! Good marijuana is expensive these days, and according to TIME magazine, the average marijuana smoker spends $1800 a year on weed (About $35 a week). That saved money can go to a better cause. 9. Social life Most marijuana users start out smoking as a social activity, but more often than not, they end up smoking alone without anyone around. We end up avoiding friends, family, and social gatherings because of the paranoia we feel while high.10. Better self esteem Psychological research suggests that heavy marijuana use can lead to depression and anxiety. Marijuana users will normally start smoking to alleviate some sort of pain in their life whether it is physical or emotional.",http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/0b/10/fa/0b10fa17-e0ba-2b55-5c85-20b5291a78ba/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,17+,EN,50759680,8.1,2016-04-21T16:09:50Z,2016-04-21T16:09:50Z,1.0,0,USD,true,953610384,"App Diggity, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4,,,,,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/8c/02/c2/8c02c2ca-b307-c62c-ce8a-a1b8557a2abf/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/69/be/38/69be38d9-5a44-cc8d-6e8a-2ed1950206ef/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/24/8e/5d/248e5d53-e52c-5ace-93ba-75de47a479b6/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/eb/d8/8e/ebd88e8d-751d-b59b-5b31-0bf3ae75675d/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/f1/45/e1/f145e127-5eac-25de-da49-59aa7df1d6a1/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/56/f4/05/56f40596-17d5-0756-d9a3-27fc935b883d/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/25/a2/17/25a2170b-85b7-036a-43eb-aee7be076a81/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3f/1f/13/3f1f135c-7815-cc8c-f859-bb49c3991ed7/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/b6/b8/bb/b6b8bb49-339f-1f3d-4221-b11baf533c2a/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/cc/b3/94/ccb39497-eee3-6c35-81b9-b1ac111241f2/sc1024x768.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

With this app, you will never forget anything again.• Apple “New Year, New You” Favorite • Apple App Store Staff FavoriteLumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life, such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. “I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'SouzaThe beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. Designed exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? Track it and get things done!:: Note to iPhone 6s & 6s Plus users Now you can ask Siri to find information for you and dictate right into Lumen Trails. For example, hold down the Home button and ask Siri: “How many calories are in a chicken sandwich?”. To start dictation, tap the microphone button on your keyboard and just start talking - your words will be turned into text. :: Have a Question? We are here to help.

No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.  You will hardly notice you've cut back until you've quit.  There is also a motivation and tip section for when you are feeling weak or you are slipping off your schedule.  The app also keeps track of some very interesting statistics including averages, maximums, minimums, saved money, saved tar and nicotine levels and more.  Even if you aren't ready to quit, get this app and run it for a while, then check the stats and you may just change your mind.- keep track of money, smokes, nicotine and more- quit at your own pace with many options to tailor to your situation- manually add or remove smokes for when you forget- motivation and tips for when you are feeling weak",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e2/91/23/e291236c-2220-af5d-df62-be5851baef12/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,EN,3641344,6.0,2011-09-13T22:25:56Z,2014-04-20T02:27:56Z,2.3.0,0,USD,true,375591377,Snappy Appz Inc.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/snappy-appz-inc./id375591377?uo=4,,,3,1,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/85/3b/98/853b9830-e56f-c312-cff7-ccddf41aa3bd/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/a3/4e/daa34ee5-ab5d-db26-d9e6-ec5daeb1608c/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a1/ae/40/a1ae4065-e404-8bf1-02f7-a2fc6d99d730/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/68/53/3a/68533ad2-819b-a62e-228c-fcdfe82cc7e7/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone-3GS,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

It may be that you only drink this way on the weekends and then function at top capacity during the working week without any alcohol at all. Or you may have a more serious drinking problem.Most common symptoms are loss of energy, minor depression, loss of motivation, anxiety and social withdrawal. It is interesting how so few regular drinkers make the connection between their alcohol intake and problems in their lives.Even this cyclical pattern of drinking can be damaging and can be stopped with a new mindset – one that can be achieved through hypnosis. Some people engage in binge drinking deliberately. Many, however, find themselves caught in patterns of thinking and behaviour that they would rather change. Whatever the reasons for your binge drinking it is possible to help you to change by using hypnotherapy and meditation.Using a combination hypnotherapy and meditations we aim to be able to 'reprogramme' the behaviour and make the experience of learning to control the consumption of alcohol a liberating experience.Affirmations and exercise are made for each other. As you work your body, the affirmations infuse your mind with added impact. After just a few workouts with this recording, you will experience the affirmations as regularly recurring thoughts in your mind. This track is designed specifically for a 15-minutes.You want to stop smoking and drinking, but you need the motivation to keep yourself on track. Stop Smoking Now Cardio Affirmation is specifically written to help you begin seeing yourself as a non-smoker and capable of kicking the habit.This track is designed to help you focus the power of your mind on overcoming your perception of yourself as someone who smokes and the physical nicotine cravings. The affirmations are backed by pulsing exercise music that motivates you to push through the affirmations and your workout to a smoke-free life and personal fitness.The track contains two primary affirmations repeated multiple times in both the first person and second person for maximum effectiveness. The primary affirmations are mixed with the repeating interludes ""Non-smoker"" which repeats 30 times and ""Winning the Battle"" which repeats 15 times throughout the track and .The primary affirmations are:1.Beginning today I am a non-smoker and non-drinkier. Beginning today you are a non-smoker and non-drinker. (Repeats 22 times)2.Nicotine and alcohol are strong, but I AM stronger! Day by day, I am winning the battle! Nicotine is strong, but you ARE stronger! Day by day, you are winning the battle!--Ray Davis, FounderThe Affirmation Spot (Website)""Because a better life begins one empowered thought at a time.""",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/6e/7e/c5/6e7ec5fe-9d3b-8cac-16c7-94dfc56e780c/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,12+,EN,57907200,8.0,2009-12-12T05:16:42Z,2016-04-11T14:44:52Z,4.1,3.99,USD,false,325075390,"i-mobilize, inc.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/i-mobilize-inc./id325075390?uo=4,,,,,"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/14/79/fd/1479fd08-6d92-ba29-4a25-928a25e3d172/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b0/fa/81/b0fa813d-bc1d-8d96-03c6-4ed9ebe333cc/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b5/e8/e6/b5e8e6fe-97ca-04c7-0b24-56d0a91f2c1d/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/58/fb/2a/58fb2a1f-4565-9459-2338-c2b6b22b58bf/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/35/55/08/35550812-1af5-fe67-0a2a-4d8beeed758b/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/64/ce/f7/64cef798-7de3-0a00-1c98-dfe9681be1fb/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/c6/6c/42/c66c4229-7c8b-47a0-7ef8-0de1fb4bbcaf/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/42/ad/88/42ad88d1-0799-ce6c-7a6d-8ad0022dae9b/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.By using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, e.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We can also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,"DA,NL,EN,FR,DE,IT,JA,KO,PL,PT,RU,ES,SV",40623684,4.3,2010-02-02T22:13:22Z,2012-08-15T18:56:27Z,2.1,0,USD,true,344500276,On Beat Limited,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4,4,53,4.5,22,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg,,,"iPhone-3GS,iPadWifi,iPad3G,iPodTouchThirdGen,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

If you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. If you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. Let's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: 1). ""Quit Smoking- Preparation"" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)Listen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. 2). ""Smoking Cessation"" You will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. 3). ""Smoke-Free Sleep Track"" Start listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! 4).

Meditation can be the help and support that you need to quit that habit. A Yale University research study confirms the benefits of Mindfulness and mediation when it comes to quitting an addiction.  The research shows that 30% of people who practice meditation to quit smoking did not smoke a single cigarette in the first week of training, versus the 6% of people who used traditional methods to quit smoking.An addicted brain is a brain with a great load of stress; it´s a brain that works too fast. Meditation gets the brain to relax and reduces the excess of its activity. Most smokers know that tobacco is bad for their health; if they don’t quit, it´s because they don´t have the necessary means and tools to say no. Meditation and Mindfulness will provide the necessary resources to quit smoking Adaptable to new iPhone 5 and iPad Mini This application will help you to: Gain the willpower necessary to avoid tobaccoCalm down before smoking so your anxiety doesn´t control you.Become aware of how disgusting tobacco smoke is (something the smoker has forgotten over time)Avoid automation of smoking; you will quit smoking in “auto pilot”Scientific studies:""Meditate daily for 8 weeks make significant changes in brain regions associated with memory, wellbeing and stress.

NO PURCHASE REQUIRED!Over 2 MILLION Jason Vale books sold worldwide and creator of the No.1 BEST-SELLING APP '7lbs in 7 Days: super juice diet’ *STOP SMOKING IN 2 HOURS requires NO WILLPOWER...NO GUMS OR PATCHES...NO GIMMICKS... Just a Simple Way to Freedom.Addiction and health author Jason Vale ran a ""Stop Smoking"" clinic for 9 years and successfully helped thousands of people to become smoke-free.  Jason used to smoke 40-60 cigarettes a day himself, until he learnt the secret to stopping in 1995, and hasn’t smoked since! Now, YOU can learn Jason’s secret from his tried and tested programme from the convenience of your own iPhone / iPod / iPad. Jason is literally in your pocket every step of the way!Stop Smoking in Just 2 hours and remain Free for Life!  There are only 2 simple steps:1) Watch the short opening video2) Listen to the two 1 hour audio sessionsThat’s it, you are now FREE - it's that easy!  Extra BONUS material includes:* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the ""5 day adjustment period""* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for lifeJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”Jason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”Appdiction Review:""Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.""",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,12+,EN,349286400,7.1,2012-01-23T04:33:18Z,2016-01-08T23:40:59Z,2.1.0,0,USD,true,493242642,Juice Master,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4,4.5,24,5,7,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.  You will hardly notice you've cut back until you've quit.  There is also a motivation and tip section for when you are feeling weak or you are slipping off your schedule.  The app also keeps track of some very interesting statistics including averages, maximums, minimums, saved money, saved tar and nicotine levels and more.  Even if you aren't ready to quit, get this app and run it for a while, then check the stats and you may just change your mind.- keep track of money, smokes, nicotine and more- quit at your own pace with many options to tailor to your situation- manually add or remove smokes for when you forget- motivation and tips for when you are feeling weak",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e2/91/23/e291236c-2220-af5d-df62-be5851baef12/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,EN,3641344,6.0,2011-09-13T22:25:56Z,2014-04-20T02:27:56Z,2.3.0,0,USD,true,375591377,Snappy Appz Inc.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/snappy-appz-inc./id375591377?uo=4,,,3,1,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/85/3b/98/853b9830-e56f-c312-cff7-ccddf41aa3bd/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/a3/4e/daa34ee5-ab5d-db26-d9e6-ec5daeb1608c/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a1/ae/40/a1ae4065-e404-8bf1-02f7-a2fc6d99d730/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/68/53/3a/68533ad2-819b-a62e-228c-fcdfe82cc7e7/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone-3GS,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!Stop smoking now to avoid insurance hikes.

I found it not only easy but unbelievably enjoyable to stay stopped.” – Sir Anthony Hopkins“Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking program achieved for me a thing that I thought was not possible – to give up a thirty-year smoking habit literally overnight. It was nothing short of a miracle.” – Anjelica Huston",http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/20/a8/4b/20a84b94-9dba-a731-6916-b7f5f8b962a0/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,17+,EN,6193152,6.0,2012-12-19T22:11:05Z,2015-01-30T18:37:58Z,1.3,6.99,USD,false,585624867,Arcturus Digital LTD,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/arcturus-digital-ltd/id585624867?uo=4,4.5,20,4.5,6,"http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9b/51/a2/9b51a24b-b1c5-d75b-8659-bf2d4a2f9509/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/82/89/4b/82894bc2-7623-35f8-64fc-b0da11d61fc7/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/95/85/1f/95851fe3-ae67-349d-f3a1-15ca5c0fc261/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/af/a3/c0/afa3c0f7-9a53-1125-3281-ff669088e91d/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/a7/92/11/a792110c-6acc-94ae-aa90-6f1c18b816af/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/2f/39/66/2f396618-7df4-ceec-7395-e7fcaeb5f398/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone-3GS,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.Successful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  The app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine.

Stopping smoking through willpower alone is almost impossible because you’ve trained your brain to automatically prompt you to smoke at certain key moments. But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way. Tim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way. Part One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking. Part Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why.  Part Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation. Part Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again. Your progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing. You’ll be amazed by how quickly you start to enjoy the benefits of being a non-smoker.",http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/77/3f/2f/773f2fcf-8fcb-1ce9-4854-cb1ca783d27a/source/512x512bb.jpg,Health & Fitness,6013,Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,46960640,7.1,2014-11-25T14:11:40Z,2015-06-30T02:16:24Z,1.2.2,0,USD,true,930436697,The Stop Switch,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-stop-switch/id930436697?uo=4,,,,,"http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/60/bf/58/60bf58a0-f8db-e981-8afd-ff78deb496d7/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/74/58/c5/7458c53b-844a-6ecc-d865-3b3079c7de1b/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d8/db/8d/d8db8d93-a790-8a86-319a-2bc3e2ccd5b5/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/6c/1f/60/6c1f60c6-0751-3406-4b3a-ea0c8df54df6/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/bf/e8/85/bfe8850a-7d98-27f0-4ba2-75d75d6fa113/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

You smell like smoke constantlyNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!2. You age quickerYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!3. Your sense of smell and taste declineBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. 4. Your social networkBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!5. Smaller dating poolAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.6. ImpotenceSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. 7. Chances of infection are increasedFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.8. Dangers to othersSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?9. Decreased physical activityMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved. Smoking causes the lungs and heart to work harder, which decreases cardiovascular abilities. 10. Cost of smoking cigarettes Just on cigarettes alone, the average smoker can spend $3,000 a year on cigarettes. If that isn’t enough to sway your opinion, think about the well being risks that you will inevitably be paying for down the road.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/4f/24/90/4f249088-aa14-5b22-592d-462930a2f322/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,17+,EN,50624512,8.1,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,1.0,0,USD,true,953610384,"App Diggity, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4,,,,,"http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/bc/52/9a/bc529a7d-6016-c9c1-c838-7bf2f5f2faed/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/79/a9/b7/79a9b76f-6780-ae0c-9cf7-2e262285c5e8/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2a/d6/8e/2ad68e70-bdb6-8bf6-3b77-b53be2f2540a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/73/79/83/7379836d-c236-740a-e36a-3f87009c6df0/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ef/50/9e/ef509e18-b6e4-752a-fe3f-5e5576ffddc4/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ba/03/e5/ba03e579-69de-97b3-df33-227994c03bd2/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/83/b1/e8/83b1e821-2cc3-7928-c29b-aff65644a046/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2b/10/7f/2b107f26-f410-9a37-deb2-d8307902b491/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b8/3a/5c/b83a5c58-0200-60b1-bc5e-b8ab4123116c/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/fc/69/db/fc69db8f-f5b0-c389-2a85-f89545e1b45f/sc1024x768.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

335619210,com.ican-hypnosis.stopsmoking,iCan Stop Smoking: learn self hypnosis and quit smoking,https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ican-stop-smoking-learn-self/id335619210?mt=8&uo=4,"Stop smoking todayThe cost of a hypnotherapy download is minimal compared with the cost of continuing to smoke...and we're not talking about the real costs here.  And the benefits of quitting are almost immediate - few days after stopping, the nicotine is out of your system - and if that were all there was to stopping, that would be fine because most smokers agree with Mark Twain that stopping smoking is not the problem, '...it's  easy,' he said, 'I've done it thousands of times.'No, the problem is not to stop smoking but to stay stopped! ...and how do you do that? - only by really dealing with the underlying psychological problem of cigarette and nicotine addiction. This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.Hypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.Hypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.And the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.So it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.It may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.Two days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.Long term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.In the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,12333056,8.0,2009-10-29T07:00:00Z,2015-10-16T12:37:44Z,2.0,2.99,USD,false,335619213,iCan Hypnosis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4,3.5,35,,,"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.By using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, e.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We can also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/1d/e5/b3/1de5b3de-9223-06c5-1831-7b35539cf83b/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,"DA,NL,EN,FR,DE,IT,JA,KO,PL,PT,RU,ES,SV",40623684,4.3,2010-02-02T22:13:22Z,2012-08-15T18:56:27Z,2.1,0,USD,true,344500276,On Beat Limited,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?uo=4,4,53,4.5,22,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6d/80/ba/6d80ba28-652c-664c-39ef-2d87e6742661/screen320x480.jpeg,,,"iPhone-3GS,iPadWifi,iPad3G,iPodTouchThirdGen,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

If you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. If you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. Let's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: 1). ""Quit Smoking- Preparation"" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)Listen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. 2). ""Smoking Cessation"" You will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. 3). ""Smoke-Free Sleep Track"" Start listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! 4). ""Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster"" This short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes. Listen to this to address any cravings that may come up, for any situations that may have triggered you to smoke in the past, and to quickly reinforce your reasons for releasing cigarettes and smoking from your life.

Meditation can be the help and support that you need to quit that habit. A Yale University research study confirms the benefits of Mindfulness and mediation when it comes to quitting an addiction.  The research shows that 30% of people who practice meditation to quit smoking did not smoke a single cigarette in the first week of training, versus the 6% of people who used traditional methods to quit smoking.An addicted brain is a brain with a great load of stress; it´s a brain that works too fast. Meditation gets the brain to relax and reduces the excess of its activity. Most smokers know that tobacco is bad for their health; if they don’t quit, it´s because they don´t have the necessary means and tools to say no. Meditation and Mindfulness will provide the necessary resources to quit smoking Adaptable to new iPhone 5 and iPad Mini This application will help you to: Gain the willpower necessary to avoid tobaccoCalm down before smoking so your anxiety doesn´t control you.Become aware of how disgusting tobacco smoke is (something the smoker has forgotten over time)Avoid automation of smoking; you will quit smoking in “auto pilot”Scientific studies:""Meditate daily for 8 weeks make significant changes in brain regions associated with memory, wellbeing and stress.

Just a Simple Way to Freedom.Addiction and health author Jason Vale ran a ""Stop Smoking"" clinic for 9 years and successfully helped thousands of people to become smoke-free.  Jason used to smoke 40-60 cigarettes a day himself, until he learnt the secret to stopping in 1995, and hasn’t smoked since! Now, YOU can learn Jason’s secret from his tried and tested programme from the convenience of your own iPhone / iPod / iPad.

Extra BONUS material includes:* Relaxation & hypnotherapy audio recommended each night for 21 days to help sustain your freedom* Daily motivational coaching videos to keep you on track during the ""5 day adjustment period""* In case of emergency two “SOS” videos to keep you free for lifeJason knows there is an easy way of curing people’s addiction to nicotine. “It simply involves understanding how the nicotine trap works and combining that knowledge with some simple instructions.” commented Jason, “the need for nicotine is caused only by the previous dose - it’s a simple chain.”Jason added, “The reason it appears so hard to stop is due to the slight empty insecure feeling that nicotine withdrawal creates. This in turn can create a feeling in the smoker’s mind of panic and fear. It is only this fear, this invisible prison if you will, that keeps people smoking. If you remove the panic and fear through an understanding of what the actual cause is, it can be very easy to stop.”Appdiction Review:""Jason’s Vales Stop Smoking in 2 Hours is a bit of a revolutionary self-help app for the iPhone. Now we have seen some really good “quit smoking” apps over the years, and the better ones utilize an element of hypnosis, but Jason Vale goes above and beyond, utilizing audio hypnosis and video coaching to help finally get smokers to kick the habit with advice so simple and practical that it almost doesn’t make sense at first listen! Jason uses that calming yet forceful British accent to constantly remind us that the pleasure or the crutch is an illusion and we will gain nothing from the smoke. The app features a video to watch upon waking, audio hypnosis for relaxing at bed time, and my personal favorite; Jason’s video titled SOS. Jason is right there on the screen, talking you off the proverbial smoking ledge when you really crave a cigarette. I found this inspiring and very practical. The videos really make this app, and add a nice, personal flair.""",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/11/91/54/11915476-414d-ca01-675c-621a57887ea2/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,12+,EN,349286400,7.1,2012-01-23T04:33:18Z,2016-01-08T23:40:59Z,2.1.0,0,USD,true,493242642,Juice Master,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/juice-master/id493242642?uo=4,4.5,24,5,7,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/dd/81/2f/dd812f74-00ba-1d16-029d-ef011647ac4f/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/5d/64/0a5d64ae-ce51-815e-d1e6-a5b681aefd8b/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9a/9c/e3/9a9ce3fd-1d8c-9fff-50db-48ee082cea2a/screen406x722.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3c/88/d1/3c88d11b-f31f-1ed0-2d7a-1db622f7a0ab/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/53/ea/7e/53ea7eef-4089-1c86-8afa-572e6ac5a916/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/06/6f/98/066f98fc-c2e4-6361-190b-ae434c325fab/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Stopping smoking through willpower alone is almost impossible because you’ve trained your brain to automatically prompt you to smoke at certain key moments. But we all have the innate ability to stop smoking, by training our brains to block out these impulses. This app explains the process like no other has ever done before and then helps do it for you with a mixture of logic, common sense, cbt and hypnotherapy in a very user friendly way. Tim Smale has worked with thousands of people over the last 15 years to change unwanted habits and behaviours. Using this experience he has created an app that works in several easy stages to break down your desire to smoke and put you firmly back in control of your life in a simple, user friendly way. Part One is ‘Getting Ready’ which prepares you for stopping smoking. This section gets you in the right frame of mind to stop by using some simple smoking exercises to establish why you really smoke and what you really like about smoking. Part Two ‘The Facts’ gives you powerful background information that you probably haven’t realised. Like why governments don’t want you to stop, the truth about nicotine replacement therapy and e- cigarettes and exactly what’s in your cigarette and why.  Part Three ‘Starting Stopping’ explains why the voice in your head prompts you to want to smoke at regular intervals and why your brain has stored this habit loop. You can begin to retrain your brain once you’ve understood this neuroscience explanation. Part Four is the ‘Stop Switch’. In this section you can create a personal strategy to stop thoughts of smoking. And with some powerful hypnotic audio you can take control back into your life. Once you hit the Stop Switch I’m confident you’ll never want to smoke again. Your progress tracker shows you just how well you’re doing from the day you activate the Stop Switch, from how much money you’re saving to how well your body is repairing. You’ll be amazed by how quickly you start to enjoy the benefits of being a non-smoker.",http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/77/3f/2f/773f2fcf-8fcb-1ce9-4854-cb1ca783d27a/source/512x512bb.jpg,Health & Fitness,6013,Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,46960640,7.1,2014-11-25T14:11:40Z,2015-06-30T02:16:24Z,1.2.2,0,USD,true,930436697,The Stop Switch,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/the-stop-switch/id930436697?uo=4,,,,,"http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/60/bf/58/60bf58a0-f8db-e981-8afd-ff78deb496d7/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/74/58/c5/7458c53b-844a-6ecc-d865-3b3079c7de1b/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d8/db/8d/d8db8d93-a790-8a86-319a-2bc3e2ccd5b5/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/6c/1f/60/6c1f60c6-0751-3406-4b3a-ea0c8df54df6/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/bf/e8/85/bfe8850a-7d98-27f0-4ba2-75d75d6fa113/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

At the end of six weeks you will no longer be a nicotine addict.3.    Quit Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.Successful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  The app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine. Break the chains of habit & addiction!Quit smoking now to avoid insurance hikes. If you continue to smoke, soon you will be subjected to thousands of dollars of higher insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. “Obama Care” allows insurers to charge a premium of up to 50% for smokers.

You smell like smoke constantlyNo one likes kissing an ashtray, but that is exactly what you taste like if you are a cigarettes smoker. Plus, your clothes, car and house constantly smell too. Nobody wants to be around that!2. You age quickerYour hands stain, your face wrinkles, and sometimes your lips can even stain! Smoking leads to biochemical changes in the body that deprives blood vessels of oxygen. This limits the amount of oxygen to your major organs. One of them being your skin!3. Your sense of smell and taste declineBreathing in toxic cigarette fumes destroys your senses, making food taste more bland. Your sense of smell also dulls because of this. 4. Your social networkBeing a smoker puts you on the fringes of society, and you will be judged for it. Nobody likes to hang out with a smoker if they themselves do not smoke. Don’t become marginalized!5. Smaller dating poolAsk anyone what their number one deal breaker is in a relationship. A lot of the time, smoking is in the top 3. Nobody wants to constantly be kissing an ashtray and worrying about if their partner is going to die from lung cancer.6. ImpotenceSmoking increases the chances of impotence drastically for men. It can constrict your blood vessels, making it harder for an erection to occur. 7. Chances of infection are increasedFlus and colds are now hunting for you, and your immune system might not be up for the fight. Tiny hairs called cilia line your respiratory tract. They are constantly shuffling bacteria out of the body. Smoking paralyzes cilia, which make it easier to get infections.8. Dangers to othersSecond hand smoke is said to cause over 50,000 deaths every year. Smoking around anyone can alter their well being. Do you want your family to go through this?9. Decreased physical activityMany smokers report diminished ability to do physical activity that they once loved. Smoking causes the lungs and heart to work harder, which decreases cardiovascular abilities. 10. Cost of smoking cigarettes Just on cigarettes alone, the average smoker can spend $3,000 a year on cigarettes. If that isn’t enough to sway your opinion, think about the well being risks that you will inevitably be paying for down the road.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/4f/24/90/4f249088-aa14-5b22-592d-462930a2f322/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,17+,EN,50624512,8.1,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,2016-04-01T03:06:55Z,1.0,0,USD,true,953610384,"App Diggity, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4,,,,,"http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/bc/52/9a/bc529a7d-6016-c9c1-c838-7bf2f5f2faed/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/79/a9/b7/79a9b76f-6780-ae0c-9cf7-2e262285c5e8/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2a/d6/8e/2ad68e70-bdb6-8bf6-3b77-b53be2f2540a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/73/79/83/7379836d-c236-740a-e36a-3f87009c6df0/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ef/50/9e/ef509e18-b6e4-752a-fe3f-5e5576ffddc4/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/ba/03/e5/ba03e579-69de-97b3-df33-227994c03bd2/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/83/b1/e8/83b1e821-2cc3-7928-c29b-aff65644a046/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/2b/10/7f/2b107f26-f410-9a37-deb2-d8307902b491/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b8/3a/5c/b83a5c58-0200-60b1-bc5e-b8ab4123116c/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/fc/69/db/fc69db8f-f5b0-c389-2a85-f89545e1b45f/sc1024x768.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

335619210,com.ican-hypnosis.stopsmoking,iCan Stop Smoking: learn self hypnosis and quit smoking,https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ican-stop-smoking-learn-self/id335619210?mt=8&uo=4,"Stop smoking todayThe cost of a hypnotherapy download is minimal compared with the cost of continuing to smoke...and we're not talking about the real costs here.  And the benefits of quitting are almost immediate - few days after stopping, the nicotine is out of your system - and if that were all there was to stopping, that would be fine because most smokers agree with Mark Twain that stopping smoking is not the problem, '...it's  easy,' he said, 'I've done it thousands of times.'No, the problem is not to stop smoking but to stay stopped! ...and how do you do that? - only by really dealing with the underlying psychological problem of cigarette and nicotine addiction. This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.Hypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.Hypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.And the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.So it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.It may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.Two days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.Long term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.In the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds. This can be dealt with by a modest dieting regime.",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/f5/2c/22/f52c2216-265d-0d0f-2337-85ad42011bf3/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,12333056,8.0,2009-10-29T07:00:00Z,2015-10-16T12:37:44Z,2.0,2.99,USD,false,335619213,iCan Hypnosis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4,3.5,35,,,"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c1/13/e6/c113e671-f89e-d86d-56cb-b23522b44d0a/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/38/54/ea/3854ea16-f642-ec11-f619-5967511c7adc/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6a/67/38/6a6738f1-5417-ab6b-8c3e-6377a06c6def/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/f7/d0/cf/f7d0cfa4-c0be-3846-329d-72b10ff3d8c8/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Smoking Marijuana overloads your serotonin receptors and decreases your motivation to meet new people. This can destroy your life if you let it. Don't let Marijuana addiction get the best of you. Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.Take a look at our top 10 reasons to quit marijuana:1. You will have a clear mind For many lifelong smokers, this is the number one reason to quit smoking. If you are finding yourself forgetting simple things and having your mind in a fog for several hours to days after smoking, then quitting marijuana might be the right thing to do.  2. Being Ambitious  Many people with bright futures have reported that marijuana use destroys their ambition. They come up with interesting ideas when they are high, but don't have the motivation to push through when the time comes. They end up being very complacent and don't live up to their full potential. 3. Being Energetic As you age, marijuana starts to take a toll on your body in many ways. Smoking pot to overcome mundane tasks is why you may have started in the first place, but after a while, your lungs will start to clog and your blood flow will slow.  4. Having better eating habits Everyone knows that smoking marijuana speeds up your metabolism, which in turn makes you very hungry. This is commonly known as the munchies. No matter what type of foods you are eating, you are still putting a damper on your overall health and digestive tract. 5. Having clean lungs There has been conflicting research about the negative effects of smoking weed, but the unanimous agreement is that you are still inhaling smoke. Chronic use can lead to emphysema, cancer, and other serious health issues. 6. Living life by the laws The longer you smoke weed, the more chances you have of running into trouble with the law. Sure, the growing trend of legalization makes us more brazen about marijuana smoking, but possession is still illegal in most states and STILL a federal crime no matter what.  7. Personal safety Is your drug dealer really your friend? He may appear to be, but somewhere along his supply chain, there is some serious illegal activity going on. People who engage in illegal activity are more likely to commit violent crimes which you don't want to be caught in the middle of. 8. Save your money I think this goes without saying! Good marijuana is expensive these days, and according to TIME magazine, the average marijuana smoker spends $1800 a year on weed (About $35 a week). That saved money can go to a better cause. 9. Social life Most marijuana users start out smoking as a social activity, but more often than not, they end up smoking alone without anyone around. We end up avoiding friends, family, and social gatherings because of the paranoia we feel while high.10. Better self esteem Psychological research suggests that heavy marijuana use can lead to depression and anxiety. Marijuana users will normally start smoking to alleviate some sort of pain in their life whether it is physical or emotional.",http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/0b/10/fa/0b10fa17-e0ba-2b55-5c85-20b5291a78ba/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,17+,EN,50759680,8.1,2016-04-21T16:09:50Z,2016-04-21T16:09:50Z,1.0,0,USD,true,953610384,"App Diggity, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4,,,,,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/8c/02/c2/8c02c2ca-b307-c62c-ce8a-a1b8557a2abf/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/69/be/38/69be38d9-5a44-cc8d-6e8a-2ed1950206ef/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/24/8e/5d/248e5d53-e52c-5ace-93ba-75de47a479b6/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/eb/d8/8e/ebd88e8d-751d-b59b-5b31-0bf3ae75675d/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/f1/45/e1/f145e127-5eac-25de-da49-59aa7df1d6a1/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/56/f4/05/56f40596-17d5-0756-d9a3-27fc935b883d/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/25/a2/17/25a2170b-85b7-036a-43eb-aee7be076a81/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3f/1f/13/3f1f135c-7815-cc8c-f859-bb49c3991ed7/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/b6/b8/bb/b6b8bb49-339f-1f3d-4221-b11baf533c2a/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/cc/b3/94/ccb39497-eee3-6c35-81b9-b1ac111241f2/sc1024x768.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

With this app, you will never forget anything again.• Apple “New Year, New You” Favorite • Apple App Store Staff FavoriteLumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life, such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. “I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'SouzaThe beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. Designed exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? Track it and get things done!:: Note to iPhone 6s & 6s Plus users Now you can ask Siri to find information for you and dictate right into Lumen Trails. For example, hold down the Home button and ask Siri: “How many calories are in a chicken sandwich?”. To start dictation, tap the microphone button on your keyboard and just start talking - your words will be turned into text. :: Have a Question? We are here to help.

No Smoking is an app designing to slowly wean you off your habit.  The app starts in learn mode where it records your habits frequency and severity.  When you are ready to quit you exit learn mode and begin quit mode.  At this point the app tailors a quit schedule based on the data it has collected during learn mode.  Unlike patches that have 3 stages which quickly drop your nicotine levels between phases, No Smoking slowly drops your nicotine levels over time.  You will hardly notice you've cut back until you've quit.  There is also a motivation and tip section for when you are feeling weak or you are slipping off your schedule.  The app also keeps track of some very interesting statistics including averages, maximums, minimums, saved money, saved tar and nicotine levels and more.  Even if you aren't ready to quit, get this app and run it for a while, then check the stats and you may just change your mind.- keep track of money, smokes, nicotine and more- quit at your own pace with many options to tailor to your situation- manually add or remove smokes for when you forget- motivation and tips for when you are feeling weak",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e2/91/23/e291236c-2220-af5d-df62-be5851baef12/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Lifestyle","6013,6012",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,EN,3641344,6.0,2011-09-13T22:25:56Z,2014-04-20T02:27:56Z,2.3.0,0,USD,true,375591377,Snappy Appz Inc.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/snappy-appz-inc./id375591377?uo=4,,,3,1,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/85/3b/98/853b9830-e56f-c312-cff7-ccddf41aa3bd/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/da/a3/4e/daa34ee5-ab5d-db26-d9e6-ec5daeb1608c/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a1/ae/40/a1ae4065-e404-8bf1-02f7-a2fc6d99d730/screen1136x1136.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/68/53/3a/68533ad2-819b-a62e-228c-fcdfe82cc7e7/screen1136x1136.jpeg",,,"iPhone-3GS,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

It may be that you only drink this way on the weekends and then function at top capacity during the working week without any alcohol at all. Or you may have a more serious drinking problem.Most common symptoms are loss of energy, minor depression, loss of motivation, anxiety and social withdrawal. It is interesting how so few regular drinkers make the connection between their alcohol intake and problems in their lives.Even this cyclical pattern of drinking can be damaging and can be stopped with a new mindset – one that can be achieved through hypnosis. Some people engage in binge drinking deliberately. Many, however, find themselves caught in patterns of thinking and behaviour that they would rather change. Whatever the reasons for your binge drinking it is possible to help you to change by using hypnotherapy and meditation.Using a combination hypnotherapy and meditations we aim to be able to 'reprogramme' the behaviour and make the experience of learning to control the consumption of alcohol a liberating experience.Affirmations and exercise are made for each other. As you work your body, the affirmations infuse your mind with added impact. After just a few workouts with this recording, you will experience the affirmations as regularly recurring thoughts in your mind. This track is designed specifically for a 15-minutes.You want to stop smoking and drinking, but you need the motivation to keep yourself on track. Stop Smoking Now Cardio Affirmation is specifically written to help you begin seeing yourself as a non-smoker and capable of kicking the habit.This track is designed to help you focus the power of your mind on overcoming your perception of yourself as someone who smokes and the physical nicotine cravings. The affirmations are backed by pulsing exercise music that motivates you to push through the affirmations and your workout to a smoke-free life and personal fitness.The track contains two primary affirmations repeated multiple times in both the first person and second person for maximum effectiveness. The primary affirmations are mixed with the repeating interludes ""Non-smoker"" which repeats 30 times and ""Winning the Battle"" which repeats 15 times throughout the track and .The primary affirmations are:1.Beginning today I am a non-smoker and non-drinkier. Beginning today you are a non-smoker and non-drinker. (Repeats 22 times)2.Nicotine and alcohol are strong, but I AM stronger! Day by day, I am winning the battle! Nicotine is strong, but you ARE stronger! Day by day, you are winning the battle!--Ray Davis, FounderThe Affirmation Spot (Website)""Because a better life begins one empowered thought at a time.""",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/6e/7e/c5/6e7ec5fe-9d3b-8cac-16c7-94dfc56e780c/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,12+,EN,57907200,8.0,2009-12-12T05:16:42Z,2016-04-11T14:44:52Z,4.1,3.99,USD,false,325075390,"i-mobilize, inc.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/i-mobilize-inc./id325075390?uo=4,,,,,"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/14/79/fd/1479fd08-6d92-ba29-4a25-928a25e3d172/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b0/fa/81/b0fa813d-bc1d-8d96-03c6-4ed9ebe333cc/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/b5/e8/e6/b5e8e6fe-97ca-04c7-0b24-56d0a91f2c1d/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/58/fb/2a/58fb2a1f-4565-9459-2338-c2b6b22b58bf/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/35/55/08/35550812-1af5-fe67-0a2a-4d8beeed758b/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/64/ce/f7/64cef798-7de3-0a00-1c98-dfe9681be1fb/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/c6/6c/42/c66c4229-7c8b-47a0-7ef8-0de1fb4bbcaf/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/42/ad/88/42ad88d1-0799-ce6c-7a6d-8ad0022dae9b/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Stop Smoking includes a conversation forum to connect with other people trying to quit smoking and can connect you to Facebook and Twitter.Successful quitting rarely occurs quickly or cold turkey. It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  The app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine.

It took time and conditioning to get you hooked.  In small steps, during these six weeks we will get you unhooked.  The app is innovatively designed to run in the background so you get messages and instructions from us.  Each week you will get new assignments dealing with delinking your triggers from smoking as well as activities to wean you from the drug nicotine.

NSBE is implemented under the First Nations and Inuit Component of the Federal Tobacco Control Strategy. Tobacco misuse continues to be the cause of a number of preventable chronic diseases leading to premature death in Canada. Tobacco use is a barometer for social inequities and by extension health disparities. Poverty, inadequate housing, welfare policies and general disadvantage lead to and link to tobacco use. The overall goal of the NSBE is that Northern Saskatchewan communities will be free of commercial tobacco misuse while being respectful of the traditional use of tobacco. While traditional tobacco is used for spiritual, cultural and ceremonial purposes, commercial tobacco is very harmful to our health. The App is designed to give the users all the information they needed to know about commercial tobacco and also traditional tobacco. The information aspect include: traditional tobacco, effects of commercial tobacco and strategies to help the user quit smoking.There are information on the healthy rewards of quitting as well as the economic benefits.The fitness aspect helps the user to track progress depending on the quitting strategy chosen. it also shows the amount saved as the user reduces the number/quantity  tobacco consumed.Damages done by cigarettes/ smokeless tobacco to your bodyEconomic benefits of quitting",http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/90/97/fc/9097fcac-3f79-5d3e-0699-cd7ee223d41f/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,4+,"CR,EN",20984832,9.0,2016-10-21T16:15:53Z,2016-10-21T16:15:53Z,1.0,0,USD,true,357410200,"Push Interactions, Inc.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/push-interactions-inc./id357410200?uo=4,,,,,"http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/b2/eb/87/b2eb8756-e29b-df79-6400-765fc173cc01/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/6e/80/48/6e80482a-a0c8-bf65-4140-51562d422f94/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/85/5a/1e/855a1e6f-6de3-2760-ece8-4cda1ad96190/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple19/v4/a4/c5/c0/a4c5c0d9-55eb-d343-e2fe-13c571f3a917/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/b7/26/f1/b726f12d-6bd9-54bf-f8c9-c7eccda96854/screen696x696.jpeg",,,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

335619210,com.ican-hypnosis.stopsmoking,iCan Stop Smoking: learn self hypnosis and quit smoking,https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ican-stop-smoking-learn-self/id335619210?mt=8&uo=4,"Stop smoking todayThe cost of a hypnotherapy download is minimal compared with the cost of continuing to smoke...and we're not talking about the real costs here.  And the benefits of quitting are almost immediate - few days after stopping, the nicotine is out of your system - and if that were all there was to stopping, that would be fine because most smokers agree with Mark Twain that stopping smoking is not the problem, '...it's  easy,' he said, 'I've done it thousands of times.'No, the problem is not to stop smoking but to stay stopped! ...and how do you do that? - only by really dealing with the underlying psychological problem of cigarette and nicotine addiction. This is the difficult part because you may not even have a bad view of cigarettes at all, maybe regarding them as allies or friends - something to turn to in times of reflection and stress.Hypnotherapy tackles these attitudes to smoking by dealing with both the positive gains from stopping smoking and the deep seated negative roots that cause you to continue to smoke... and here, dealing with the negative roots of smoking is most important because if you don't do this effectively, you soon come to the view that you've been deprived of something and from there it's just a matter of time before you go back to smoking again.Hypnotherapy (hypnosis) is probably the best way to prevent these relapses because it deals with both the emotional and psychological aspects of stopping smoking, both negative and positive and also with the latent and persistent belief that in stopping smoking you have lost something. This is the core of the problem of giving up - an unconscious deep seated conviction that if not eradicated by hypnotherapy, makes a return to smoking inevitable. Hypnotherapy prevents such a relapse by removing these deep rooted and underlying causes and so makes a return to smoking a complete irrelevance.And the negative aspects of smoking do not need emphasis here, they are too well documented to require repetition - mostly questions of health and longevity. The positive sides are much more appealing and fruitful to pursue - so it is those that hypnotherapy tends to emphasize; the recovery of good health and fitness, a new freedom and renewed energy to do new things previously considered out of reach or even already foreclosed.So it is worth going through this sequence of cause and effect, the immediate changes that follow the final cessation of smoking.It may be hard to believe but in the first 24 hours after stopping, your blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen levels return to normal and by the end of that day, carbon monoxide will have completely disappeared from the body and your lungs will be clear of mucus and other smoking debris.Two days later, food will taste as it used to - and after three, you breathing will be coming back to normal. Energy levels will correspondingly rise as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. Your blood circulation also begins to improve and as you lung functions improve, there will be a significant reduction in coughing and wheezing.Long term; after a year, the risk of heart failure is reduced by half and in ten, that of lung cancer by the same amount.  Fifteen years further on and the chances of heart failure will be the same as if you had never ever smoked.In the first month after stopping smoking, you will also have to cope with early withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and aggression, depression and restlessness.  Withdrawal symptoms are common to stopping any drug use - and, as with smoking, will also be purely temporary. The one particular downside expected will be an increase in weight - an average of six to eight pounds.

I went from smoking 10 cigarettes a day, literally afraid to leave the house without a pack and a lighter -- and after 21 days I have been able to stop smoking altogether. This would never have been possible without Craving to Quit.- Michael, Washington, D.C.""[D]uring the couple of weeks I used [Craving to Quit], I learned many skills that I apply on a daily basis. Learning to surf my way through cravings was the best thing I learned because I no longer give in to craving cigarettes like before. I tested this skill while on a recent trip to Las Vegas where smoking is prevalent…I can now say cigarettes are not part of my life as before.""- Robert, San Bernardino, CA",http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple60/v4/cb/3c/45/cb3c4560-9c98-cce4-bdca-53eb494105c4/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Education","6013,6017",Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,24390656,7.0,2012-12-17T21:32:01Z,2016-10-03T21:23:26Z,3.2.7,0,USD,true,585558469,"Goblue International, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/goblue-international-llc/id585558469?uo=4,3,22,5,1,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple62/v4/7b/3a/06/7b3a06c1-ca0d-5003-5290-f6c606fb0c67/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple71/v4/53/43/45/5343457a-59b0-1911-5117-6de0709c3a82/sc1024x768.jpeg,,"iPhone4,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive, making the process of quitting often very prolonged and difficult.Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide, and quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk of dying from tobacco-related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer. Seventy percent of smokers would like to quit smoking, and 50 percent report attempting to quit within the past year. Many different strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including quitting without assistance (""cold turkey"" or cut down then quit), medications such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline, and behavioral counseling. The majority of smokers who try to quit do so without assistance, though only 3 to 6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful. Use of medications and behavioral counseling both increase success rates, and a combination of both medication and behavioral interventions has been shown to be even more effective.Because nicotine is addictive, quitting smoking leads to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as craving, anxiety and irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally endeavor to address both nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal symptoms.With this app you can learn on the Go, Anytime & Everywhere.

Ours is the most effective and safest method to quit smoking.  If you really want to stop, this will make it easy and safe. Many smokers who try to stop using other methods, report that they suffer misery and depression caused by the feeling that they are being deprived of a pleasure or a crutch. The beauty of our technique is that it removes the feeling of deprivation. It removes the need and the desire to smoke. It is based on NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming) and incorporates the power of hypnosis.Every smoker knows that smoking is bad of them, and they do it anyway because of an unconscious belief that it somehow provides a benefit.  Hypnosis and NLP help the conscious and unconscious work together to stop smoking.",http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/aa/b9/b1/aab9b134-f010-a318-c210-43f8cd8ee967/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,4+,EN,165212160,6.0,2013-05-29T20:22:02Z,2015-05-07T16:14:48Z,1.6,0,USD,true,632342210,Karl Zimmer III,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/karl-zimmer-iii/id632342210?uo=4,,,,,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/a2/11/4a/a2114a31-2f4a-9da7-ec1c-4369aafa0a19/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/d5/c6/b0/d5c6b054-5880-bfe9-2ac7-3d90e8342dbb/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/ed/e7/ef/ede7efcb-75ad-671c-11c4-80cd1a43b703/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/88/d3/ef/88d3efe1-0637-f777-9187-8308c3b4d8e1/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9c/fa/a9/9cfaa901-8b60-3187-8c47-0dfa92bef144/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/53/3c/b8/533cb89c-d705-b14e-1a0b-5e37940d46f8/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/c3/8b/2a/c38b2a7a-abc8-902a-7186-a4b98b4d977d/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/34/3a/38/343a3830-9eab-ec73-4d1b-51c89ef8f136/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone-3GS,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Much like a cigarette but large and does not contain additives. Mostly Cigar tobacco is grown in countries like Brazil, Cuba, Cameroon, Indonesia, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua etc. Explorer Christopher Columbus is generally credited with the introduction of tobacco to Europe. Two of Columbus's crewmen during his 1492 journey, Rodrigo de Jerez and Luis de Torres are said to have encountered tobacco for the first time on the island of Hispaniola, when natives presented them with dry leaves that spread a peculiar fragrance. Over a period of time Cigar has become very popular and later on become a status symbol where many kings used to smoke Cigar in currency notes.

But why do so many people fail? The reason is, as so often, in ourselves. We consciously know that smoking is injurious to health.

This vicious circle can be broken with the powerful technique of hypnosis..!The suggestions in this program will help you change the way you think about smoking. Get the necessary motivation for building a new healthy life-style without cigarettes and nicotine. Listening to ""Get smoke-free!

This app combines ancient Chinese healing techniques used in acupuncture and qi gong to quit smoking naturally, without patches, vaporizers, gums, or any other chemical substances.  Install this app to access:- detox stretch / qi gong video- hypnosis audio to break addictions- step-by-step guide to reduce cravings - positive reinforcement techniques to quit smoking- psychological techniques to automate new habits - calculate money saved and health benefits for your lifespan- support your goals by dedicating your progress to friends, family, and loved ones- track progress, view history, capture repeated triggers and trends- count total days logged on and celebrate your successesDetox Stretch / Qi Gong VideoHaving physical support is critical, especially for the first month as you quit smoking.  If the chemicals in cigarettes have side effects on the body, why would we use chemical solutions like nicotine gum, patches, and electronic cigarettes to quit?  Will power cannot stop your body from going into withdrawal.  Will power cannot force the body into clearing toxins.  Physical addiction to smoking happens because the body becomes dependent on the chemicals absorbed when smoking.  When those chemical levels drop, your body goes into withdrawal and wants to smoke again to alleviate the pain.  Doing detox stretches will support the body, soothe discomfort, and help transition through the withdrawal period.  A gentle healing method based on Chinese medicine, Qi Gong works with the energy in the body to naturally cleanse and restore balance.  Awaken the body's natural intelligence, stimulate your internal systems, and direct vital healing energy to areas in need of revitalising.   Hypnosis Audio to Break AddictionsAddiction is a pattern of behavior that has become so ingrained in the subconscious that we become attached to it even if the conscious mind tries to stop.  If the conscious mind could stop with a simple decision, then it wouldn't be an addiction.  The difference between an addiction and other desires is control.  The subconscious mind controls the automatic functions of the body.  You don't have to remind yourself to breathe in and out to stay alive, the subconscious mind is handling that for you.  When the subconscious mind attaches meaning to a pattern of behaviour, it doesn't matter if the conscious mind tells it to stop because the conscious mind is no longer in control.  You need to access the subconscious mind to make a lasting change.  Using will power alone to quit smoking can feel useless, disappointing, and stressful.  Hypnosis allows you to work with the subconscious mind, so you can connect to the source of the addiction and stop smoking easefully and naturally.Step-by-Step Guide to Reduce CravingsRe-train your brain to make healthy choices by using positive reinforcement and proven psychological techniques to automate new habits.  It only takes 21 days to create a new pattern of behaviour.  Follow the program for 21 days in a row and quit smoking for good!Set Goals and Monitor ProgressView your history to see how far you've come, calculate the money you saved, see your health benefits, and celebrate your successes!Dedicate Your Progress to Friends, Family, and Loved Ones (optional)Simply click the Edit Button to upload a picture of someone close to you and enter their name to remind yourself of why you are willing to get healthy and stay healthy.

Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.Top 10 reasons to quit drinking alcohol:1. Your immune system will thank youWithout the negative impacts of alcohol, your immune system will grow stronger. Liquor and other alcohol can wear away linings in the mouth and throat too, making pathogens able to take over more easily. First, it produces an overall nutritional deficiency, depriving the body of valuable immune-boosting nutrients. Second, alcohol, like sugar, consumed in excess can reduce the ability of white cells to kill germs. High doses of alcohol suppress the ability of the white blood cells to multiply, inhibit the action of killer white cells on cancer cells, and lessen the ability of macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factors.2. No more hangoversAs you age, your body starts to become less efficient at breaking down hangover causing toxins. For those who have experienced a terrible hangover, we don't really need to say anymore here. It is simply not worth it. 3. You will save plenty of moneyAccording to EventBrite, the average partier spends $81 (USD) on a night out drinking and on average, they go out twice a week. Doing some simple math here, that means that you will be saving almost $8500 a year if you cut out the drinking. Invest the money or buy yourself something cool!4. Your problems actually make senseWhen you're drunk, little problems become big problems for no reason. When you're sober, you actually have to face reality and you wont be worried about petty things anymore. 5. You will actually remember thingsHave you ever gone out for a night of drinking and didn't remember the night? Or maybe even didn't remember bits and pieces? Well that will not happen anymore if you stop drinking. 6. No more losing friends over drunken mistakesA lot of bad decisions go out the window when you stop getting drunk, and as a result of making fewer poor decisions, your friends will like you more.7. It's interesting to go out soberIf you usually went out to get all boozed up with friends, it can be hard to turn back the habit. But you'll realize with time that you don't need booze to have fun. It is a hard habit to kick, but you will become more comfortable with yourself as you progress. 8. You learn why you like your friendsYou'll find that some friends were just friends you went out and drank with. Those friends won't likely hang around. You will find out who your real friends are and get to know yourself better. 9. You find out you can have fun aloneAlcohol can be a real toxic habit, and without it you'll find more about yourself than you knew before. You might just find that you can have fun all by yourself.10. You look betterAlcohol damages the liver which makes you look a little rougher around the edges. In the end, you'll look younger longer.",http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/c7/6e/c3/c76ec332-e213-436d-7430-47e97202673e/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Health & Fitness","6012,6013",Lifestyle,6012,17+,EN,50669568,8.1,2016-04-01T16:21:28Z,2016-04-01T16:21:28Z,1.0,0,USD,true,953610384,"App Diggity, LLC",https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/app-diggity-llc/id953610384?uo=4,,,3,1,"http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/df/06/74/df0674e6-83af-20d9-9229-4cec6a1a440c/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/b4/06/ca/b406caa7-decc-3c65-602d-2e07dca3ea50/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/16/07/bd/1607bd20-481d-7b54-55e7-eacf464602b2/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ed/d8/f8/edd8f801-12c4-70ee-91a7-e6de75b2d643/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/94/c0/c7/94c0c716-5870-08c3-eb9e-71ee3c86e1ca/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/e2/df/d2/e2dfd2b6-6645-0e86-a6d5-88907a24adb7/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/cd/37/71/cd377185-9c54-a155-d547-ded4fb57563a/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/ef/70/c1/ef70c1fe-4018-776f-7f1e-2d96c88186d4/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/fe/b0/36/feb0363c-f36a-bbb9-85cb-f2fdecb76558/sc1024x768.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple49/v4/a3/0c/0d/a30c0dbf-3173-4ba8-72fb-12109385ff40/sc1024x768.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Alcoholism occurs when a person becomes completely dependent on ‘the drink’ to get them through daily life, even at the cost of any problems that may arise, and is sometimes indicative of a physical addiction as well. There are many reasons why people drink. Social situations and psychological factors are the most common. However, those with a family history of excessive drinking are also at a high risk for becoming alcoholics themselves, due to a genetic predisposition to the disease.An addiction to alcohol can take its toll on a person’s life, causing problems at work or with friends and family. It is a debilitating disorder that can lead to various health conditions, such as:• sleep deprivation• blackouts and/or confusion• mood swings (varying from depression to violent outbursts)• anemia• seizures• liver and other organ damageEven if an individual suffering from alcoholism genuinely wants to stop drinking, quitting can be very difficult. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to severe (requiring medical help) and are sometimes a reason many continue drinking. For those who do go into a detoxification program, it is often recommended to treat the anxiety associated with withdrawal symptoms.This is a condition that responds well to self-hypnosis, a safe, drugless therapy that has been shown to have remarkable effectiveness, even when other treatments may fail. It is a particularly successful method when the source of a problem is emotional or tension-related, however deep-rooted it may be. Self-suggestion is a process which strikes at the core of a problem, rather than simply masking the symptoms, making it especially helpful for a variety of complaints.The very term “Hypnosis” is a direct reference to the ancient Greek “Hypnos”, meaning sleep, and indicates the relaxed, sleep-like, state that is necessary for suggestion to take effect. However, many often have trouble reaching this deeper level of consciousness on their own and require the assistance of a skilled hypnotherapist to ease them into, and out of, a hypnotic state. Mr. Mackinnon is such an individual, having helped countless people over the years to achieve their goals through guided self-hypnosis. The advancements of the Internet have allowed him to make his technique available to more people than ever before. His new iPhone app is designed to work with you, at your own pace, directing your transition from start to finish and ensuring maximum results.",http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple32/v4/88/71/0d/88710d9a-f033-0c2f-f4a3-caa80b1b679f/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Health & Fitness,Medical","6013,6020",Health & Fitness,6013,12+,EN,11837440,8.0,2009-12-18T03:43:06Z,2015-10-16T12:41:01Z,2.0,2.99,USD,false,335619213,iCan Hypnosis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ican-hypnosis/id335619213?uo=4,3,18,1,1,"http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple32/v4/a4/02/ca/a402ca5f-dd69-9f13-cea2-255017d443d5/screen696x696.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/80/29/14/802914f7-336b-9b63-2f22-d7e97627ebe3/screen696x696.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/bb/ab/5b/bbab5b3b-fcfd-7a6b-9b79-aa9ce77679d9/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple32/v4/b8/6d/68/b86d689a-add7-5c3c-269f-d0c51734c245/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

Since it is legal, and our culture finds no problems with it, coffee flies under the radar as a normal way of life, but it can cause severe problems in your life, just like any other addiction. Coffee Addiction Calendar addresses the need to quit coffee, and helps you become accountable for making the changes happen!Features:1. 40 Motivational quotes that will help you overcome your coffee addiction.2. 10 Science based facts about coffee addiction, and reasons to stop drinking coffee.3. Daily ticker that keeps you motivated to succeed.4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed. 5. Our special panic button will help take your mind off of having an urge to drink coffee by showing you pictures of puppies.6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success. Here are our top 10 reasons to quit drinking coffee:1. The caffeine in coffee increases your stress hormone productionCatecholamines (or stress hormones) are increased with coffee consumption. This also increases your insulin production which causes inflammation which in turn ends up making you feel sluggish.2. Coffee decreases insulin sensitivityWhen you are less sensitive to insulin, your cells are tricked into not responding appropriately to blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can lead to deterioration of your arteries and eventual increased risk of cardiovascular disease.3. Increase of the release of diterpenes into your systemDiterpenes have been linked to increased levels of LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides. Coffee addiction will perpetuate these issues and you will constantly have to monitor your levels.4. Drinking coffee increases your anxietyCoffee stimulates your adrenal glands, which activates your “fight or flight” response. This increases your anxiety and you may feel as if you are in a constant state of panic or nervousness.5. Did we mention the financial benefits of quitting coffee? Coffee is expensive! If you are brewing your own coffee, you still have to purchase the equipment to brew it. If you are going to Starbucks every day, you are spending money on that. Average coffee addicts report an average savings of $2000 a year after quitting coffee.6. Stop the jitters	Everyone who has drunk coffee before knows what the jitters are. The sudden burst of energy that comes from drinking coffee is usually not channeled properly for maximum production, and you end up just shaking because of the excess energy.7. Addiction and reliance to coffeeWe are here because we know that coffee addiction is a thing. Any addiction can have serious repercussions if not properly checked. If you find yourself needing coffee at all times, this is an addiction that you need to break if you want to have a stable life.8. Sleep like a babyHave you ever been up at night after a day of drinking coffee and wondered why you cannot sleep? Chances are it is the coffee. From everything mentioned previously, you can understand why this is the case. From adrenal production to jitters, these are some things that you do not want in your life.9. More stable moodThe life of a coffee addict is up and down like a roller coaster. You are down when you don’t have it, and up when you do have it. Quitting coffee will make you mind more stable and keep you on a level playing field.10. Healthier teethNo more stains on your teeth! Really, there are not many long term benefits to drinking coffee, so take the step now and really work on breaking the addiction.If you are struggling with a coffee addiction, simply download No Coffee Calendar now and break free of your reliance to coffee.

New Year’s resolutions usually fail. They don’t work because people jump into them without the right preparation. As I learned from my own experience, you can’t be successful in the action stage if you haven’t been successful in the preparation stage.And did you know that for every person who quits smoking by following a treatment program, there are almost twenty persons who quit on their own?Many people spend years telling themselves that they’re going to change “one day.” They spend years worrying about the problem instead of working on it. Maybe they’re waiting for the “perfect” weight-loss program, the “perfect” smoking-cessation program, or the “perfect” time to stop drinking. “I’ll change when the time is right.” How many times have you heard that one?In this special book, you’ll learn how to turn your life around!Here is what you will learn inside this book....# The six stages in the process of breaking bad habits# How to replace bad habits with a healthy new lifestyle# How millions of people have succeeded in breaking a bad habit# Why you have a better chance of freeing yourself from a bad habit by taking responsibility for your own program# Why successful preparation for change means that you set goals for yourself# Why change is not an event, but a process# Why most successful self-changers fail at least once before they succeed# Why willpower alone isn’t enough# Why quitting a habit cold turkey usually doesn’t work# Why a commitment to a more active lifestyle is one of the keys to breaking a bad habit# And a lot more!When you win the battle in your mind, it’s only a matter of time before you win the war against bad habits. The secret is to make change your No. 1 priority.You can’t win the war until freeing yourself from the habit becomes your highest priority.The solution is to accept responsibility for yourself, to realize that you can decide to take charge of your life.The key to freeing yourself from bad habits is to change your lifestyle. A total lifestyle change isn’t something that happens overnight.It happens one day at a time, and it starts when you begin to focus on the solution instead of the problem. Don’t be surprised if you’re not completely sure that you’re ready to break your habit. It’s not about quitting cold turkey. Forcing yourself to quit before you’re mentally and emotionally prepared usually backfires.Free yourself from bad habits forever by start reading this book!*** On Sale Now!

We can replace maladaptive behaviors, i.e., rather than thrashing out verbally and/or physically we can walk away, rethink the situation, calm down and use our intellect to dispel negative barriers and replace them, providing a positive path to success.Hypnosis as a stand alone therapy works very well but COUPLE that with some easy to apply behavioral or thought substitutions and it becomes EXTREMELY POWERFUL.",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/0e/49/cb/0e49cbd0-73da-0f0c-67d9-ef361fb2a48d/source/512x512bb.jpg,"Lifestyle,Medical","6012,6020",Lifestyle,6012,12+,EN,54243328,5.0,2013-01-23T00:19:04Z,2013-11-15T22:26:52Z,3.5,0,USD,true,572987888,Jere Parker,https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jere-parker/id572987888?uo=4,2.5,11,3.5,5,"http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/a4/da/bf/a4dabfc0-238f-e871-68d1-8947291a4171/screen322x572.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/97/23/0c/97230c75-6c4c-cebb-d60a-09d7db3d75ba/screen322x572.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/7e/a7/6a/7ea76a57-c6c9-b9b7-75b5-c785870e74a9/screen322x572.jpeg,http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/f7/6d/86/f76d8659-2501-a1f7-7b16-07a420eed7cf/screen322x572.jpeg,http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/28/08/d0/2808d02b-58f7-8580-50ac-99ec6c40fd51/screen322x572.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/20/ee/d5/20eed54d-5bd6-ad12-d68f-2af8f7060e35/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/23/69/4a/23694a4a-5fa3-c55b-119d-8de1684f1015/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/0e/04/88/0e048828-d8d1-b066-fd9d-95e0bea0f61b/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2d/e3/db/2de3dbc0-9ca9-1fb2-4976-19a4e3b77f76/screen480x480.jpeg,http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/9a/cc/e6/9acce6da-84f8-edb9-e263-507bc1584f07/screen480x480.jpeg",,"iPhone-3GS,iPadWifi,iPad3G,iPodTouchThirdGen,iPhone4,iPodTouchFourthGen,iPad2Wifi,iPad23G,iPhone4S,iPadThirdGen,iPadThirdGen4G,iPhone5,iPodTouchFifthGen,iPadFourthGen,iPadFourthGen4G,iPadMini,iPadMini4G,iPhone5c,iPhone5s,iPhone6,iPhone6Plus,iPodTouchSixthGen"

I’ve tried out several of these apps and this one is perfect. I get especially anxious at nighttime and can’t fall asleep, this app is so effective I don’t even know what it talks about because I’m out within the first 5-7 minutes. Life changing! It says that you start noticing results after a week, I felt calmer and more rested after listening to it for only a few days. Better than expected. Recommended to all my friends.""""Amazing. I started this more for serious stress that had under tones of anxiety. I really didn’t expect much out if it. Within a weeks time I was feeling calmer and better able to focus when issues did arise. Additionally I found that even when I couldn’t play this app- I found myself re-playing it’s principals in my head anyhow. In short it works. I am a believer. My head is clearer and things are getting back on track because of this app. Extremely pleased.""""Fantastic app. Love this app really working for me couldn’t recommend it highly enough !!!""""I have been experiencing a slow down at work for nearly 2 years. Thus, I’ve been home a lot more in these last two years. My son has some minor behavioral issues that have come to dominate our daily lives. I had found my self stresses, depressed, and angry all the time. I greeted every day with anxiety, dreading what new frustration it had to offer. I have been using this app for a little less than a week and I am already a lot happier and better able to roll with whatever comes up. I started this because I felt I was not being a good father or husband. I felt drawn more and more to find a pharmaceutical solution to this ever present sense of failure and anxiety.

TALKSPACE IN THE PRESS• “The process was identical to what I had experienced in traditional therapy, except that I had access to it anytime I pulled out my iPhone.” – Wall Street Journal• “Roughly 46 million Americans had a mental illness in 2011 but only 39% sought treatment. Barriers to seeking treatment include the cost, stigma, and time commitment. Talkspace aims to erase those barriers.” – CNN• “It’s really like texting. It’s easier to write out my feelings, rather than when you’re sitting in a room with someone and it’s hard to explain things.” – Mashable• “I spent 7 days with a therapist who only knew me via text message and I might never go back to traditional therapy again.” – Business Insider• “By keeping users anonymous, Talkspace hopes to alleviate the stigma that currently prevents 28% of people who need mental health care, but don’t receive treatment, from finding a therapist.” – The VergeHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?For only $32 per week (billed monthly), Talkspace members gain unlimited access to a licensed therapist, free from appointments and the inconvenience of traveling or taking time off work. Our pricing plans are 80% lower than the average co-pay for traditional, in-office therapy appointments (which are usually only one hour long and twice a month). WHO ARE THE THERAPISTS?We have over 1000 licensed therapists in the Talkspace network with thousands of years of combined medical experience! Our counselors’ backgrounds vary, specializing in issues that include: stress and anxiety, depression, LGBTQ issues, domestic violence, PTSD, repression, phobia, work/life issues, chronic illness, and many more. Each Talkspace counselor undergoes an extensive background check to ensure proper qualifications and a proven track record of providing excellent service and guidance. IS TEXT-THERAPY EFFECTIVE?Some studies show that online chat therapy is as effective as traditional therapy. Other research demonstrates that online therapy is sometimes more effective than face-to-face therapy, as text-messaging allows for more immediate care and higher engagement. IS TALKSPACE SAFE?At Talkspace, your privacy and safety are always our first priority, so you don’t have to worry. We go to great lengths to ensure user data is kept secure and confidential. Our system is encrypted at the highest industry standards (Privacy Policy can be found at http://www.talkspace.com/public/privacypolicy).

Tune your mind to help you with pain or depression.HOW DOES IT WORK?Once you choose a particular frequency, such as the 'sleep' (brainwaves) frequency, this state is then more quickly achieved than normal. This is done by a mixing of tones sent to each ear - the difference between the two tones, that your brain creates, is called binaural entrainment. We also include isochronic entrainment, which is a different form, using a single pulsating tone in each ear - people who don't respond to binaurals, often respond to isochronics.THE ONLY APPAmbiScience is the only app, which includes binaurals and isochronics in ONE. PROGRESSIVE ENTRAINMENTThis app also offers Progressive entrainment, which is a gradual inducement to your chosen entrainment (brainwaves), and this is done by starting at the waking state frequency and gradually moving the user down to his/her chosen frequency.FEATURES:- 20 LONG Professional Ambient Tracks- 13 Nature Sounds and Sound Samples- 6 BRAINWAVE/ENTRAINMENT PROGRAMS:-- 3 Isochronic Entrainment Tracks-- 3 Binaural Entrainment TracksIncludes 2 Progressive Entrainment Tracks• Create your own CUSTOM programs• MULTITASKING background audio available!• PLAY YOUR iPod MUSIC with entrainment!• PERFECT Seamless Loops • Full-Featured presets / Multi-Track Save• Countdown Timer with fader• Countdown end chime• Alarm with Snooze option• Auto Quit/Exit feature• Adjustable independent volumes• Highest quality audio• Easy to use interface• Easy Instructions & Free UpdatesBRAINWAVE/ENTRAINMENT PROGRAMS:(headphones/earbuds or 2.1 speakers are RECOMMENDED - the iPhone/iPod speaker is not able to produce some of the frequencies below)- 6 Entrainment Programs• 25min.

SuperBetter increases resilience - the ability to stay strong, motivated and optimistic even in the face of difficult obstacles.  Playing SuperBetter makes you more capable of getting through any tough situation—and more likely to achieve the goals that matter most to you. SuperBetter was created by Jane McGonigal, a world-renowned designer of games to improve real lives & solve real problems.►► Why play SuperBetter?SuperBetter has helped nearly half a million people so far achieve personal growth and tackle real-life challenges. Here are reasons people around the world are using SuperBetter:- To adopt a new habit, develop a talent, learn or improve a skill, strengthen a relationship, make a physical or athletic breakthrough, complete a meaningful project, or pursue a lifelong dream.- To beat depression, overcome anxiety, cope with chronic illness or chronic pain, heal from physical injury, or recover from post-traumatic stress.- To overcome a life challenge like finding a new job, surviving divorce, dealing with a career or school setback, or grieving the loss of a loved one.- To help others: therapists recommend SuperBetter to their patients; university professors incorporate SuperBetter into their student’s coursework; and HR professionals design SuperBetter into their employee wellness incentive programs.  ►► SuperBetter is Living Gamefully“At the heart of SUPERBETTER is a simple and potentially transformative idea: We can use the same psychological strengths we display when we play games to confront real-life challenges, whether it’s illness, injury, or just changing our habits for the better.”– Daniel H. Pink, bestselling author of Drive and A Whole New MindLiving gamefully means bringing the same psychological strengths you naturally display when you play games – such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination – to your real life.  It means having the courage and openness to try out different strategies to discover what works best.  It means collaborating with allies, and building up the resilience to tackle tougher and tougher challenges with greater and greater success.►► The Science Behind SuperBetterPowered by the science of games, positive psychology and behavior change.SuperBetter is validated in two clinical studies:• A randomized controlled study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that playing SuperBetter for 30 days significantly reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, and increases optimism, social support, and player’s belief in their own ability to succeed and achieve their goals.  They also found that SuperBetter users were significantly happier and more satisfied with their lives.• A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital found that using SuperBetter improves mood, decreases anxiety and suffering, and strengthens family relationships during rehabilitation and recovery. ►► Features• The SuperBetter app is an everyday coach for gameful living• Identify your Epic Win and create your Secret Identity • Recruit Allies to support your journey• Choose pre-loaded experiences (PowerPacks) or design your own adventures • Complete Quests, activate PowerUps and battle Bad Guys each day• Track your resilience scores – mental, emotional, social & physicalLive Gamefully.

Even if you aren’t depressed it helps your mood and makes me think more clearly!!!! I am hooked for sure!!! Have recommended to several friends!""""I have been doing this self asteem app for just over five weeks. I feel different. I have noticed I’m more out spoken. And I’m going to places on my own again.Thanks !!""""It was very easy for me to visualize and focus on. I have used many other hypnosis apps but this one seems to be the best fit for me.""""I have downloaded most of their app. I feel an inner peace in moments of anxiety– like I can handle it, no matter what comes my way. I’ve been in therapy and medication for years now, and while I can’t say this is the cure it all, it certainly helps a great deal. You see, I’ve come to realize we often sabotage any attempt of change because it feels challenging– even when is for the better. It’s like our conscious mind sabotages our efforts subconsciously. Hypnosis works in a subtle, yet powerful way by sending affirmations to the subconscious– the part of us that doesn’t know right from wrong, only what we make it believe; it’s why our inner thoughts about ourselves become an integral part of how we see the self, not necessarily who we are. Thoughts are powerful and so is the subconscious. Definitely recommend.""THE BEST SELF-ESTEEM HYPNOSIS APP AVAILABLESelf-Esteem Hypnosis is FREE and effective with the default settings.

You move on to the first set of skills, where you will select one of ten ways to change your thoughts. If you are not sure which skill to select, shake the iPhone or iPod and one will be randomly chosen. Changing your thoughts to change your feelings is the basis of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, the most widely practiced and evidence based form of psychotherapy.  After utilizing one of the thought changers, you proceed to selecting one method for making lifestyle changes that will reduce depression (or again, you may shake the device for a random selection).  After following the instructions for the lifestyle changes, you then move on to the third set of skills, where you will select one of ten different relaxation strategies for managing stress, or shake the device for a random selection.After implementing those skills, you rate the level of depression again to determine if the skills you chose were effective for you.  If the level of the depression has not reduced sufficiently, you will be given the opportunity to try again, selecting a different skill set. The content presented is for your information only.

That is exactly why Calmster was created. Multiple scientific studies show that meditation and mindfulness are utterly helpful in curing emotional disorders like depression, panic attacks, stress, PTSD and many others. Calmster was designed to introduce meditation and mindfulness practices into your life by periodically interjecting simple meditation assignments and mindfulness reminders into your everyday activities. These prompts will remind you to stay in the present moment leaving no chance for unwanted mental patterns to take over. Here are some of the benefits of mindful living: •	 Less stress, depression, pain and anxiety•	 Calmness, relaxation and balance•	 Better handling of feelings and emotions•	 Improved intuition, clarity and understanding• 	 Control of thoughts and reactions•	 Better decision making, attention, memory and learningBUILD CONSCIOUSNESS AND MINDFULNESS MUSCLES TO FIGHT ANY EMOTIONAL DISORDERSMost of the emotional disorders happen due to lack of conscious control. That is how different unconscious patterns, which are mostly conflicting to each other, take over and start affecting our mood and behavior. The solution to this is simple – training the consciousness muscle to stay always present and notice how these patterns work and when they are triggered. Meditation and mindfulness practices in essence are designed to do just that - train and develop consciousness. In Calmster we have created series of meditation assignments and mindfulness reminders which will be coming to your phone throughout the day with a frequency that you configure in the app settings. These assignments and reminders will help you stay alert in the here and now leaving no chance for unwanted unconscious patterns to take over your moods and behavior. REGULAR PRACTICEThe more you practice meditation and mindfulness, in any possible way, the better and steadier will be your emotional wellbeing. Calmster is designed to help you in this practice without making you dependent on the app. Rather teaching you the skills and techniques so that you can implement them in your life on your own. Start leaving a better life now.

With this app, you will never forget anything again.• Apple “New Year, New You” Favorite • Apple App Store Staff FavoriteLumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life, such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. “I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'SouzaThe beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. Designed exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? Track it and get things done!:: Note to iPhone 6s & 6s Plus users Now you can ask Siri to find information for you and dictate right into Lumen Trails. For example, hold down the Home button and ask Siri: “How many calories are in a chicken sandwich?”. To start dictation, tap the microphone button on your keyboard and just start talking - your words will be turned into text. :: Have a Question? We are here to help.

If you are completely 100% committed to do what it takes to quit smoking once and for all, then download this program and take action now. Although smoking is a physical addiction, it can be overcome mentally by reconditioning your mind's thought process through hypnosis. If you truly understand the health risks and financial burdens of smoking, then you know the importance of quitting. Let's dive into the 4 content packed audios included in this program: 1). ""Quit Smoking- Preparation"" (This first audio is FREE so you can try before you buy the full package)Listen to this half-hour track 1-2 weeks before the actual day you will be quitting. As its name suggests, it will prepare you during your final week or two of smoking. It will do this by: conditioning you to hypnosis, addressing your reasons for quitting, easing you into your last day of being imprisoned to smoking, and allowing your unconscious habit to be made more conscious to you. This track should be listened to as much as you can during those final weeks. 2). ""Smoking Cessation"" You will listen to this track only once, on the day you free yourself from Cigarettes. It addresses such areas as: your first smoking experience, reinforcing your reasons to quit, developing a new self-image, your smoking triggers, replacement behaviors, and creating a compelling future. 3). ""Smoke-Free Sleep Track"" Start listening to this track as you fall asleep at night on the day you listened to the Smoking Cessation Track and freed yourself from cigarettes. You should listen as you go to sleep for at least 2 weeks from the day you quit. It will help to reinforce your replacement anchor, your reasons for quitting, and pulling you forward into your positive, compelling future. It may also help you sleep better! 4). ""Smoke-Free Reinforcement Booster"" This short, booster track can be listened to as much as you'd like once you're free from cigarettes. Listen to this to address any cravings that may come up, for any situations that may have triggered you to smoke in the past, and to quickly reinforce your reasons for releasing cigarettes and smoking from your life.

This is one of the most treatable mental health problems. Whether through counseling or psychotherapy, it is possible to successfully navigate out of this state of mind and be freed from the sadness.

I’ve tried out several of these apps and this one is perfect. I get especially anxious at nighttime and can’t fall asleep, this app is so effective I don’t even know what it talks about because I’m out within the first 5-7 minutes. Life changing! It says that you start noticing results after a week, I felt calmer and more rested after listening to it for only a few days. Better than expected. Recommended to all my friends.""""Amazing. I started this more for serious stress that had under tones of anxiety. I really didn’t expect much out if it. Within a weeks time I was feeling calmer and better able to focus when issues did arise. Additionally I found that even when I couldn’t play this app- I found myself re-playing it’s principals in my head anyhow. In short it works. I am a believer. My head is clearer and things are getting back on track because of this app. Extremely pleased.""""Fantastic app. Love this app really working for me couldn’t recommend it highly enough !!!""""I have been experiencing a slow down at work for nearly 2 years. Thus, I’ve been home a lot more in these last two years. My son has some minor behavioral issues that have come to dominate our daily lives. I had found my self stresses, depressed, and angry all the time. I greeted every day with anxiety, dreading what new frustration it had to offer. I have been using this app for a little less than a week and I am already a lot happier and better able to roll with whatever comes up. I started this because I felt I was not being a good father or husband. I felt drawn more and more to find a pharmaceutical solution to this ever present sense of failure and anxiety. I don’t event give the use of substances a second thought now.""THE BEST ANTI-ANXIETY HYPNOSIS APP AVAILABLEEnd Anxiety Hypnosis is FREE and effective with the default settings.
